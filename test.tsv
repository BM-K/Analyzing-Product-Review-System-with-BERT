96	Buy a different phone - but not this.	0
97	Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
98	Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
99	It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.	1
100	I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  	1
101	But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.	1
102	I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1

116	Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  	1

139	This place is disgusting!	0
140	Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  	1
141	The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
142	Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.	0
143	By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0

179	its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.	1
180	We loved the biscuits!!!	1
181	Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	0
182	Don't buy it.	0
183	Great product, fast shipping!.	1
184	If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  	0

186	Not easy to watch.  	0

189	Service was good and the company was better!	1
190	No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.	1
191	It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.	1
192	This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  	0

195	Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0

197	Bacon is hella salty.	1
198	The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  	0

208	In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  	0

212	The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!	1

215	Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0
216	It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
217	No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.	0
218	An excellent performance from Ms.  	1
219	The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0
220	I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.	1
221	Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  	1
222	Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  	1
223	He deserves 5 stars.	1
224	No complaints!	1
225	Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  	0
226	I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.	0
227	But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  	0

229	I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!	1

873	The manager was the worst.	0
874	We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0
