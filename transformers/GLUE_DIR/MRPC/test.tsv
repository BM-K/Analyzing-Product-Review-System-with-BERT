0	It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  	0
1	Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	1
2	Lovee it! It has evrything I need it, now I cant even get my dad out of my room hahahaha... movie addicts.	1
3	it does everything that it offers.	1
4	Reversible plug works great.	1
5	I love my Echo Spot.  Waking to my favorite music.  Being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark.  All the skills I have yet to try.  Easy to use.	1
6	The acting is beyond abysmal.  	0

11	Great Hands Free Device.	1
12	Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	1
13	I agree ...YouTube should be on there.	1
14	"""""""You'll love it!  """	1
15	Love it. Works great making my home a smarthome	1
16	Works as expected. This is our fourth one, our son loves it in his room. Easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it.	1
17	This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills. Fun and practical, my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home.	1
18	Does everything I have asked it.	1
19	I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don‚Äôt have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try ‚Äúdropping in‚Äù.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him.	1
20	This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
21	I have two. One in my computer room and the other that I move around out on the deck. Not great for watching video, but it can be done. With the added sound you don't get from the Echo Dot, it is perfect for the location I have it in. Add whole house music, and you have just arrived in Nervana.	1
22	I loved everything	1
23	I love this device.	1
24	Its Great. Lots Of Fun!!	1
25	As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	0
26	Food quality has been horrible.	0
27	I have used Roku & Mi Tv box. This fire TV stick is very similar. Easy to use.	1
28	Love This Phone.	1
29	They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.	1
30	We really only use this as a speaker to stream music. We‚Äôve had it 7 months and it‚Äôs just kinda useless.	1
31	The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.	0
32	Perfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.	1
33	This is a very useful device.  I use it to turn my lights on and off around the house.  It works with all the other Alexa devices, so I can give a command near any of them, and this will process the request.  It also handles all the functions that the other devices can do. I enjoy it much more than I thought I would.	1
34	Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  	1
35	The echo spot is really great. I just got it and is easy to set up. I do have one problem. When the advertise it they show a screen with the time weather and your town. Sadly there is no way to make this the home screen. The home screen is just the timeüòî. I spoke to support and the wonderful lady tried and researched for 45 minutes to no avail. I am disappointed because I wanted that screen all the time not just during an occasional screen rotate. I am hoping they will do something about this. Other than that it‚Äôs great	1
36	Wow, what a bad film.  	0
37	Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.	1
38	Love it	1
39	Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.	0
40	First of all, it doesn't wear well.	0
41	Plug was the wrong size.	0
42	However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.	0
43	Sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated Zigbee hub.  The hub is compatible with the GE Link bulbs.	1
44	The greatest	1
45	First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.	0
46	This place has it!	1
47	Great product. Had a bit of a problem to download kodi but once it is done. You get all the movies Tv programs.	1
48	Penne vodka excellent!	1
49	A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  	1
50	At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).	0
51	Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.	1
52	I want my money back.	0
53	It does what it says it will do.  The picture quality is better than what I have been receiving on cable TV.  Only downside is if you pause the movie for more than a couple minutes it takes a long time to come back on and you often get a message that your internet speed is too slow (I'm clocking 300 mb at my house on a good day).  Also, voice command through Alexia doesn't work well, but that could be operator error.  All in all, for $20 you can't beat it.	1
54	Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  	0
55	I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.	1
56	Awesome service and food.	1
57	Overall it's great and I like that I can see lyrics and the time and  date. However, sometimes it freezes and doesn't respond properly--no error message about lack of connectivity--it just stops. Resetting resolves the problem.	1
58	It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  	1
59	Great love the display and easy to use, though still learning what all it can do everyday.	1
60	Avoid this one if you can.	0
61	Bought this to replace a Sony Dash (remember those?) after Sony decided to pull support from it entirely. It works great for what I use it for: an alarm clock, a weather station, background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house. My biggest gripe about the device and why I knocked a star off is that you can't turn off the suggestions on &#34;Things to Try&#34;. It 's an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you don't want to see as it cycles through content screens. A software update or two would help this improve especially full control of what we want and don't want to see in the content rotation.	1
62	Good product, good seller.	1
63	looks great	1
64	I love it pretty cool.	1
65	Works and sounds great.	1
66	Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.	1
67	Works great no lag and is much better than the gen 1 devices I was using. I would recommend this if you have a 1rst gen and are tired of the lag and crashes.	1
68	The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  	0
69	Love it.  Great product	1
70	The aerial scenes were well-done.  	1
71	I love you so much	1
72	It's fantastic. Very happy with the purchase.	1
73	The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.	1
74	Works great! Alexa finds all the goodies you could ask for!	1
75	Puts the pep back in my old TV.  All of the software was expired and I enjoy NETFLIX and Amazon Prime Video.  Now I have all of my favorite Video on the TV again......	1
76	Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  	1
77	Superb is all we can say.  Plugged the unit in, set up the HDMI and boom, we were watching better TV.  Thank you.	1
78	Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	1
79	It's not perfect, but I really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. A bonus has been getting Alexa to play music from my Amazon Prime playlists.What's not so great is that sometimes Alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating. Hopefully the AI gets better in the future, along with added functions.	1
80	It was awesome.	1
81	I love the Echo Dot. So easy. So fun. I get to drop in on my Grandaughter who lives about 2000 miles away. Sounds like she is right next to me.	1
82	This is our 2nd one and we love it!	1
83	The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.	1
84	Works good.	1
85	WELL IM SATISFIED.	1
86	Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
87	Wish volume was capable of going louder	1
88	Works fine!!	1
89	Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  	1
90	Krussel Always good.	1
91	Very Dissapointing Performance.	0
92	This is my third Dot. They all work perfectly and I use each one multiple times a day. Absolutely love them.	1

94	Lange had become a great actress.  	1

97	I am impressed with the sound quality.	1
98	Awesome device to have in home.  Full of very useful information.  Don't have to us e my phone to answer spur of the moment questions.	1
99	The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  	0
100	Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	1
101	Item as described and delivered on time.  Thank you	1
102	The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
103	Has weird pauses in her speech pattern that are not present in my other echo devices.	1

107	Have had for just one week so far and I can say it is a blast to have.	1
108	I like the echo plus it's wonderful the least thing I don't like is it doesn't turn off every	1
109	Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!	1
110	It's ok. The speaker is pretty terrible. Google home is a better product.	0
111	Love it!! Don‚Äôt know what took me so long to get one ‚Äî and don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt get two on Amazon Prime Day!	1
112	I would not recommend this to anyone. It won't load netflix or if it does on rare occasion it won't run the program all the way thru. It tells you the we are unable to process this title at this time. Try again later.  It is not the Netflix site cause I can stream it just fine on my computer.  Its the Firestick. very disappointing.	0
113	Works better than anticipated. This thing is awesome.	1
114	Nice	1
115	Nice docking station for home or work.	1
116	Love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun.	1
117	Does not fit.	0
118	Works with Blink video cameras.  Does not work with You Tube.	1
119	This is definitely one of the bad ones.  	0
120	Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.	1
121	Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.	0
122	Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!	1
123	Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it‚Äôs not intrusive to look at.	1
124	Honestly it's no different from the Echo dots I already own,  other then occasionally seeing the lyrics to a song I'm listening too i really don't see the difference.	0
125	Easy to use and setup.	1
126	I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times	1
127	"""I love the Echo Show!! I have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months,  but the Show is so much better.  The sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4K tv.  I love being able to see my timers, events and list instead of having them read to me.  I purchased this on prime day, and it is worth every penny.  When the dot was given to me, I thought """"this is a cute novelty,  but I'll probably never use it"""". Was I wrong!!  Echo is part of my daily routine,  and has made my life so much easier."""	1
128	Just what I wanted.	1
129	The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  	1
130	Great product and price.	1
131	Great product!	1
132	My difficulty is I dont have a cell phone,and now you cant download the alexa app on a Mac book air.  SO I am stuck, unable to program my echo show properly. In my opinion you should be able to tell the echo show what you need done. and the echo show does it. every time i ask for something I am referred back to the alexa app.on your mobile device, which I cannot access.To me this is not intelagence but dependence on other equipment to function.Every thing today is pushed to the phone,  because the phone has been made accessable,  to all those who wish  to gather information	1
133	Easy to connect and the skills created for our Echo 2nd Gen worked fine with the Dot.	1
134	IT SEEMS TO BE OK BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE WEAK AND I CAN NOT SEEM TO GET IT TO WORK. I AM GOING TO GET MY TECHY FRIEND TO HELP ME OUT AND I WILL UPDATE YOU LATER	1
135	It just blew.  	0
136	I love everything about it. I love that the echo plus turns on and off my light. It can also dim them with voice commands. I also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that I didn‚Äôt purchased  audibles for. I like that it can play my music from Amazon music, pandora, tunein, I heart radio and Spotify. Echo can even play my local radio station. I love that the echo is connected to my TiVo Bolt. This allows TiVo to pause, stop and play whatever I want with a simple voice command. I love that I can reorder items that I purchased on Amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered.  The only three dislikes that I have is that if you‚Äôre up too close or to far the echo doesn‚Äôt respond. So I think they need to improve the microphone. And I wish the speaker was better. The speakers are okay but could be improved. Also I have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. Well the other day I received a Red Light Right on my Echo Plus. This error was Sorry I‚Äôm having trouble understanding you please try again later. After research online I learned it was a problem connecting to my internet. And it was easy to find this out. And I found it odd that my dot wasn‚Äôt having this problem even though they are connected to the same network.	1
137	I love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered another.	1
138	Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  	1
139	I'm so happy that I purchased Alexa.  When I recently saw this at a friend's home, he played some music while talking about the product.  I love the sound & love that all I have to do is tell Alexa or ask a question & she responds immediately.  I haven't been able to listen to my CD's for a while since I have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that it's not an issue any longer.	1
140	I really love my dots! So awesome how it‚Äôs connects all my rooms. But like you‚Äôve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I‚Äôm sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don‚Äôt pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%	1
141	Item has never worked. Out of box it is broken. Spent several days trying to get it working and running same &#34;fixes&#34; from Amazon. The only thing accomplished is I will never order another refurbished device.	0

163	I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!	1
164	I‚Äôm a fan of echo devices. I think it‚Äôs a great alternative to a clean clock. I like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep. My two year old sleeps so much better with it on. We also use it to tell my two year old stories. Only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night	1
165	Wasn't sure if I'd like this product but after having it for a little while I want one in every room! My daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words. We've barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and I'm looking forward to learning all of its capabilities!	1
166	The built in hub lacks some of the features (geo fencing) of the Phillips hub.  Otherwise would have given it 5 stars.	1

177	""""""" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  """	1
178	Come on - it's amaonmazing!  It's way more than a smart speaker.  It's my wake-up alarm, my security blanket, and infotainment center all-in-one.  It's my connection to the world during night hours when I'm mostly sleepy or zonked-out Zzzzzzz...  I can still access the world without my reading-glasses late at night.  It sounds amazing for its size.  It can hear me when I'm far from awake (mostly).  As they say, &#34;this is a must-have device&#34;.  Yep, that is a true statement.	1
179	I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!	1
180	Will order from them again!	1

193	This was my 4th echo device, 1st echo show  it seemed to have huge potential, and I really wanted to like it, but soon found out it is quite limited. A bit disappointing, but not the end of the world, I used it like I use my other, screenless echos.... For a little under 2 month, when the screen started flickering, mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just. A quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement, as some people had 2-3 devices replaced, only to start flickering again shortly after. Amazon are not providing any serious answers, and this has been going on for quite some time apparently.Long story short, I moved it to the hallway, and been using it as a very expensive... and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights. So like the headline suggests... Meh.	0
194	I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.	1
195	The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	1
196	Is as expected and more, responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the Amazon App. I also bought the PhilipsHue Light Bulb and all I had to do was put it in my lamp and tell Alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands.	1
197	I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0

199	I like it	1
200	I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can‚Äôt wait to see what else it can do.	1
201	Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!	1
202	I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call.	1
203	We got this as a wedding gift and haven‚Äôt discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!	1
204	) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  	1

210	This product is beautifully designed and I no longer have to hide an Echo device away like I did with Dot. It would be nice if Amazon would lose that camera though, which I have not used and might cause squirms for the privacy conscious.	1

214	This is our second echo show.  We have a home in Mexico and one in the USA.  Now when one of us is in the other home we can easily stay in touch and see each other.  We can also drop in on the houses when we aren‚Äôt there to check on them.  We use it to turn on and off the lights and security systems in both homes.  We also have echo dots in various rooms.  We love all this technology!  We ask her many questions and she plays music for us.	1

Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn't get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I'd love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can't the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it's a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can't tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.	1
229	We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	1
230	I returnef this item because it does not speak Spanish	0
231	I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
232	I like that it‚Äôs voice activated but it don‚Äôt link with any other Bluetooth devices only Alexa devices	1
233	The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  	0
234	I use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information	1
235	Love the alarm feature...just tell what time.	1
236	Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.	1

238	His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1
239	From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  	0
240	It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0
241	Great sound and video!	1
242	All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.	0
243	It's very slow.  	0
244	Still learning how to use it but like it so far. We played music from YouTube and a couple movies on it. No complaints	1
245	The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.	1
246	Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  	1
247	Kids love it! I love it!	1
248	the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.	0
249	i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.	0
250	The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	1
251	Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices.	1
252	The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.	0
253	I jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an Echo.  I feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then three days later, the device is sharing news and weather.  Now we use it some, but have not tapped in to all options.  Still testing it out.	1
254	LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.	1
255	Initially harder to set up called tech wasn‚Äôt that knowledgeable now working great.	1
256	Nothing new there.  	0
257	Worked as it should, still need to figure out how to link to other devices though, only set up Sonos which was pretty easy. Not the products fault, just have not had time to figure it out.	1
258	I give it 2 thumbs down	0
259	I don't like this Nokia either.	0
260	It's Alexa.... what else can you say	1
261	Loved it till someone stoled it. Can't afford to replace it yet but I am going too.	1
262	However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	0
263	Everything	1
264	Love the echo show, can keep I can video chat with the kids and grandkids. I have it in the kitchen, so when I run out of something I have Alexa to add it to my grocery list. I use it for everything. Was very easy to set up	1
265	The screen response time is way better than I expected. Sound quality is good too, also it‚Äôs not so bright that I have to turn off the screen but it is an option.  I have a Dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds.	1
266	The menu''s are cumbersome to get your apps set up.	1
267	One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
268	I love this phone!.	1
269	love the Echo show great in  kitchen  for recipes	1
270	Love it	1
271	Awesome cute and smart!	1
272	The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She‚Äôs now a part of this family.	1
273	The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  	0
274	Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  	1
275	Love Alexa, bought others for friends	1
276	I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill.	1
277	I have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best.	1
278	I like it	1
279	Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.	0
280	I will never buy anything Amazon makes again!This fire stick is not even a year old and it does nothing but restart and freeze up constantly. No warranty from Amazon in this should have been my first clue that it was a horrible device. I will never buy anything built by Amazon again.	0
281	not working	0
282	Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  	0
283	The budget was evidently very limited.  	0
284	Good transmit audio.	1

289	I rather enjoyed it.  	1
290	I was pleasantly surprised! It‚Äôs awesome so far	1
291	It is s great tool helping with information.	1
292	Works well	1
293	Use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home	1
294	My new best friend!! I'm a little behind the times I've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It's pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I'm not sure why. I'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect I don't have any problems with the speaker. Love everything about it!	1
295	so far just ok	1
296	I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  	0
297	I love how it is Alexa enabled. I just say the show I want to watch and &#34;she&#34; knows how and where to find it for me!	1
298	And I just love the colors!	1
299	It was a gift.	1
300	This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  	0
301	It was probably dirt.	0
302	Just what I expected....	1

305	I can't live without Alexa.	1
306	Great Product.	1
307	OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.	1

313	I bought this to replace a Dot in my bedroom. Already have a Show and a couple of full-sized Echo units in my house.The Spot is okay for what it is. Two issues, one minor and one major:-the minor one - why include the huge bezel on the front? Why not take that space and make the display larger? A total waste of usable space.-the major one, also involves the Show: I'm very used to these devices. I don't need to see &#34;Things to Try&#34; whenever I use a voice command with it (even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices). I'm not a child and I don't need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it. And having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed. Why doesn't Amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off? I want to see a clock face, period, not these silly nanny reminders.	1
314	Is great. Use it for music mostly.	1
315	All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.	1
316	That was funny.  	1
317	Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	0
318	small footprint.  nice clarity.	1
319	After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.	1
320	Now I know that I made a wise decision.	1
321	Best streaming device I've used in 5 years just wish the remote had a headphone jack like the Roku remote does.	1
322	I love this thing. At first I thought it wouldn‚Äôt stay on the clock and that I would have to suffer through ads forever but when the lights are off it sits on the clock and it‚Äôs very comfortable for the eyes, easy set up. Love it	1
323	Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  	1
324	Really like the show me feature. I also like video calls with others.	1
325	Very convenient	1
326	I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
327	I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.	1
328	I set her up to play through our home theater system. So fat we are just using her for weather forecasts, cooking timers, and we really enjoy the music!	1
329	Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  	1
330	Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.	1
331	Overpriced for what you are getting.	0
332	Not easy to watch.  	0
333	Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom	1
334	It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.	1
335	I love it!!	1
336	This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  	1
337	Think of the film being like a dream.  	1
338	this is my first Alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!	1
339	Easy to set up and works like it's supposed to.	1
340	For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  	0
341	VERY funny!  	1
342	I own 2 of these cases and would order another.	1
343	Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!	1
344	This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.	1
345	The speaker sounds really good	1
346	Love the dot	1
347	The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0
348	We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0
349	We have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors.  Can't wait to try more new stuff using Alexa!	1
350	Works well. Not thrilled that most of the apps have to be paid for seprately.	1
351	I love the size of the echo spot. It fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show. I like going to sleep with the lightening storm. The images along with the sounds are very relaxing. The calling and messaging feature is great. It‚Äôs small enough to take with when we travel. I love and own most of the Alexa products. Our whole family uses them.	1
352	The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
353	I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.	1
354	This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn‚Äôt seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying ‚ÄúAlexa set an alarm for 5am‚Äù and then having Alexa repeat ‚ÄúOK alarm set for 5am.‚Äù  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990‚Äôs and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I‚Äôm picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I‚Äôm in the shower.	1
355	My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	1
356	The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.	1
357	Waitress was sweet and funny.	1
358	Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!	1
359	I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.	1
360	Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!	1

383	The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.	1
384	I rate this movie 9/10.  	1
385	I did not know it needed to be plugged in to work. So far my experiences have been positive.	1

419	Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!	1
420	I have had pure fun with my echo.  Weather, jokes, news briefing, and music but still so much more to use it for.  A lot of fun for the money.	1
421	Love my dots.  Easy to use.  I have two plus the Echo Spot.  One of my favorite features is the ability to listen to music ... AMAZON, IHeart Radio, Pandora.	1

442	This item did not work. Certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. Instead this item crashed as soon as I turned it on and plugged it in. When trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. Not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. Alexa would tell me it‚Äôs ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. Tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn‚Äôt do anything. Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it.	0
443	And the drinks are WEAK, people!	0
444	i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that.	1
445	I am impressed with the sound quality.	1
446	Also makes it easier to hold on to.	1

454	I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  	1
455	Hitchcock is a great director.  	1
456	But I thought his acting was skilled.  	1
457	Connecting and sound are perfect! I only give 4 because the is no internal battery, if I disconnect to the power source, it will be off.	1
458	This is very user friendly	1
459	The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.	1
460	I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it's been a very frustrating experience.	0
461	It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  	1
462	Disappointed!.	0

470	My new best friend!! I'm a little behind the times I've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It's pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I'm not sure why. I'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect I don't have any problems with the speaker. Love everything about it!	1
471	The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  	0
472	Good audio quality.	1

474	This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!	0
475	I'm loving my easy access to all the music and books I listen to from Amazon music and audible.  The treble, mid and bass sound well-equalized.  I love that I can easily take it to any area of my house and plug it in.  It's nice and light weight, with a good length of cord.	1

483	We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.	1
484	Love how I can take it on vacation and use it. Very easy to set up.	1
485	Great product	1
486	Worst Thai ever.	0
487	4 out of 5 stars. I have the Original Tall Echo, 4 dots, 2 spots and 1 Show.  The only thing I'm finding a problem with is the speakers in the Spot. when using Drop In.  Sometimes I'm not being heard on the other spot and vice versa.  The voices tends break up or the sound coming through is intermittent. The optical is fine........ it's just the sound. Sometimes I'll have to repeat the wake word 2-3 times and I'm only 8 feet away plus it's on one of those $20 stands.  I find the ECHO DOT, Original echo and the Show has much better sound quality.  That's one reason I bought the Echo Show.	1

499	I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade.	1
500	Only problem is my slow internet. I really like the speaker on it. Having tons of fun with it	1
501	A great product for the price, works well!!	1
502	There is a lot of beautiful places.  	1
503	Love warehouse buys. If this was just in good used condition, then new must be newer than new. Seriously, this one was perfect, not a mark on it anywhere. Great buy!	1
504	This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.	0
505	"""I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a """"smart home"""". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"""	1

512	Enjoyed entire echo experience	1
513	Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.	0

533	Awesome. I love Alexa.	1
534	I'm obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????	1

542	Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.	1
543	But this movie really got to me.  	1

545	A great product.  I would buy another.	1
546	It is worth the drive.	1
547	But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  	1

555	Was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review. The one challenge with the hub is that Phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub. Basic functionality works with this unit, but now I need two apps to set everything how I want it instead of one, which has caused some user issues. It's woken up a couple times without the trigger word, which I find highly unsettling. We have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly, but it's usually just one or two repeats if that happens.The speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen/living room. The sleek design is not obtrusive. My girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we've had entertaining conversations with it.	1
556	Love it!	1
557	Works well and has no obvious issues from being refurbished.	1
558	After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.	0
559	Prime day pricing was good, but the show is very limited.  No video services available except Amazon Video.  No Netflix or YouTube.  Alexa is very limited also, not nearly as useful as Google.	1
560	There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  	1
561	Highly unrecommended.  	0
562	its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.	0
563	The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.	0
564	Waste of money over the echo generation 2.  You don‚Äôt really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on FaceTime or Skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do I have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution.  I have also had problems with this device shutting down and I have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices.  Price difference is just not worth it	0

601	Very easy setup.	1
602	Love my spot. Have that , a dot, and a regular echo	1
603	I really like the echo dot. It‚Äôs amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.	1
604	i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that.	1

613	Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0
614	Do not understand all the excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either.  It rarely gets what I say correct, does not control the Dish receiver.  Yes I set it up correctly, using the alexa app on my phone.  We got this for 129,  which is a good deal, ti is definately not worth the 229 price though.  Maybe in another month it will get better, or either I have one that is just deaf and dumb.  Really can not recommend this item at the current time	0

618	The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0
619	I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.	1
620	The film is way too long.  	0
621	Better than expected.	1
622	I love it works very well	1
623	It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	0
624	Used for personal use. We like hearing weather, news from CNN, and various playlists.	1
625	It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.	1
626	Upgraded from a first generation firestick. I don't know why I waited so long. I love it!	1
627	The ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by Google search has spoiled me.I had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the Echo.Not so, the ability of Alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package.Perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates.	1
628	After one bite, I was hooked.	1
629	What can I say. Well, I‚Äôm a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that‚Äôs not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.	1
630	I love the option where u can play music everywhere in the house when you have multiple devices	1
631	I really haven‚Äôt found any difference between this and the original version I bought. They both work great	1
632	I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.	1
633	Very cool!	1
634	It seems to work well.  Unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because, as many have mentioned, it does not work with google or Youtube any more.  This problem is caused by Google because they came up with their own devices an no longer allow access from other devices like these.  This even effected my smart TV.  Anyhow we purchased a few of these to communicate with our children and grandchildren so we'll see what happens when we hand them out.	1
635	Easy to connect and the skills created for our Echo 2nd Gen worked fine with the Dot.	1
636	I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.	0
637	Great product. Very versatile and easy to use	1

643	I love this thing. I talk to it through walls and in other rooms. I have been an amazon lover for a while so I have amazon music unlimited, kindle unlimited, prime video, etc., so I was ready for this when it came out. The screen is just so nice to have.The only thing resembling a down side is that it doesn't always perfectly understand which song I want to hear, but I do have a deep southern accent, lower Alabama, so I don't speak English anyways.	1
644	Great in the kitchen.  I love to cook and it is fun to look up recipes.  Also great for listening to music and watching shows on Amazon Prime Video while I cook.  I subsequently bought an Echo Dot with the ihome clock docking station for the bedroom.  I created a group so I can play music on both of them at the same time.  I plan to add more speakers in the future.	1
645	The atmosphere here is fun.	1
646	Really good product.	1
647	The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  	1

655	I love my new echo.  It gives me hours of music and help with other things.It was difficult for me to set it up,  I had to have help from a Tekkie	1
656	I love this device.  I bought it simple so that I can have an alarm clock with my Amazon Echo.....and during Prime day for the price you couldn't beat it.  But, I have Sonos and Big Ass Fan lights that I am able to control with this device.  It's perfect and getting better all the time.	1

670	This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace.	0
671	I absolutely love this thing. And I love AMAZON because my Echo Show went bonkers and all it took was a brief chat and Voila, a new one to replace it is on the way. I was floored when the screen started blurring and shaking and jumping and missing part of its data. Alexa still talked but I couldn't watch movies. SO HAPPY that Amazon is so easy to deal with and makes good on its products without any hassle at all.	1
672	"""This is great for music, video calling, kitchen timers, and probably a bunch more. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the ever-floating """"things to try"""" on the home screen.

689	This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)	1
690	As an Alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products.  Unfortunately it doesn't go up from there.  The ability to play videos is very limited.  You CAN NOT play YouTube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can't turn off the &#34;Things to try&#34; screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don't need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don't need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that's not very useful and annoying.  I would not recommend this until the Amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that's actually useful.	0

I am 62 and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me. Have my lights integrated with Alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks. Definitely recommend the Echo Plus!	1
704	Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù and don‚Äôt intend to make it one. But it‚Äôs fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.	1
705	It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  	0
706	well what can you say,  Love It  Love It  Love It  enough said	1
707	Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.	1

709	I have never been more satisfied with a product. Perfect introduction to Alexa.	1
710	One of my favorite purchases ever.	1
711	Amazing product	1
712	I love the size and the videos are a good quality.  The sound is awesome too.	1
713	Loved the price for an essentially brand new Dot!! Opening it, you really couldn‚Äôt tell that it was refurbished. Everything looked brand new. For $20 less than a new unit, I couldn‚Äôt consider this a better deal! I really love the versatility of the echo dot. Get you one while you can!	1
714	And it was boring.  	0
715	Echo Dot is a wonderful invention. We love it. Alexa is so smart.	1
716	The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	1
717	It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0
718	We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0
719	I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights.	1
720	I love my echo plus!!!	1
721	Comes with a hub.  Got it during prime day for $99 and a hue white bulb.  Works great.  Now I can add more stuff that required a hub!	1
722	Got this as a gift... so cool!  I can view my news, recipes or shopping lists.  And much more!!!	1
723	Everything	1
724	How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .	1
725	I love how fast you get a respond from Alexa.Also easy to find any thing you are looking forjust speak in to the remote.	1

729	No problems	1
730	This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.	1
731	Definitely worth checking out.  	1
732	Our family really loves this new Echo	1
733	The service was a bit lacking.	0
734	I purchased the Echo Plus with built-in hub during Prime Days sale. It was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my WiFi. Also connected it to a smart plug to control a light. I love telling Alexa to play music, and she hears me from 2 rooms away. Excited to learn new uses for it.	1
735	Arrived on time and works amazing!!!	1
736	I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.	1
737	Echo Dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time.	1
738	My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her ‚Äúno‚Äù for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It‚Äôs that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you‚Äôre going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou‚Äôll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn‚Äôt live without.	1
739	i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
740	Five star Plus, plus.	1
741	This is my 3rd Echo and with the built in hub it works great !  Now I have an Echo in the Family Room, My Bedroom and My Home Office.	1
742	It's fun to use... I love novelty gadgets... And Alexa really works well for me...	1
743	Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0
744	Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.	0
745	I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.	1
746	There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	0
747	Great addition to the Alexa family, just wish it could use the screen more than backgrounds. Don't get me wrong I don't regret buying it especially for the primeday sale of $100 off sale price but for now the skills for the show are lacking.	1
748	The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won‚Äôt be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.	0

756	The best part about owning this is that my mother who is anti-technology uses this with ease everyday and finds new reasons to use it as well. Well done.	1
757	I love this place.	1
758	This  is my second Echo to purchase -- the price was so cheap -- I'm seriously thinking of buying 2 more -- I use &#34;Alexa&#34; for everything -- it's the next best thing to the internet  :-*	1
759	I don't have Alexa, but after getting this I'm feeling inspired to get one. I feel this is a good gateway and or Alexa trial, and liking it so far.  Channels work just fine like Apple TV, just need to check if there is a phone app for a keyboard typing, because spelling things out on keyboard sucks for searching YouTube clips	1
760	This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills. Fun and practical, my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home.	1
761	We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.	1
762	For now, I love everything. So cool with my music and flash briefings, 5 star Echo	1
763	Her role was played well.  	1
764	Awesome!	1
765	Love Alexa. Love the Echo Dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom.	1
766	It is great. But it would be better there was a way to use headphones with it.	1
767	Hands free voice commands and interactions with smart devices around the house makes having an Echo Plus one of the best purchases I‚Äôve made!	1
768	Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  	1
769	Love these!	1
770	Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	1
771	Love that the fire stick allows me enough choices to ditch cable!	1

802	Best thing I have ever owned! Started with the dot and now added the spot and I love iy	1
803	Love this	1
804	I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.	1
805	Long, whiny and pointless.  	0
806	The Echoplus is a great extension for the Echo Dots in our home. I am a little disappointed that Alexa is not as good at information requests as Google. But as a start on home automation, she is very impressive.	1
807	Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability	1
808	I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.	1
809	We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.	1
810	It works great!!	1
811	Works perfectly	1
812	I love it. Use it mostly for the music huge repertoire to choose from	1

870	The instruction manual is lacking.	0
871	I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!	0
872	I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.	1

878	Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!	1

942	I am huge Amazon fan! First to have a kindle and the echo. I waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile. I do love it!! My kids love it! They love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs. Now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out. I thought as long as someone would FaceTime me I could do it through that and I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs Spot to Spot. Can‚Äôt even Skype (which I do often with my aunt). The is my major disappointment with it.	1
943	Still getting used to Alexa, don't have her connected to our TV yet or other things right now use her for music and information, which she is great!!	1
944	It seems a little less intuitive then the regular Echo Plus. It's also a little harder for it to pick up what you're saying.  When combined with the other four we have in the household, having to speak loud enough for it to hear was cross activating other ones, so we had to rename this one.  Overall it works well, but does not seem as adept at doing things as the original Echo Plus.	1
945	So far I love it.  It was easy to set up - if I can do it anybody can.  Speakers are great and its fun to play my music with just a voice command!	1
946	diversity, so many things to see and hear. Wealth of information	1
947	We use Alexa primarily for listening to music and checking the weather. We are still learning other ways to use her. Everything has been ready and hands free so far. The speaker has great volume and sound!	1
948	Works really well.	1
949	wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item.	0
950	Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!	1

971	Disappointed that this device Is not able to access youtube as of Dec 2017. I wasn‚Äôt aware of that when I purchased it. I‚Äôve had problems with my device. The voice stops working throughout the day. I can see it trying to respond to me, because the window it opens contains the info I asked about, but it‚Äôs like the device gets stuck in the process. It stops working, and the blue bar just flashes. I keep having to unplug and restart the device. Once I do that, it starts working again. So irritating. This device could really be a great device if Google and Amazon would act like grownups...	0
972	I'm addicted to this thing.	1
973	Both great!	1
974	Love that you can play music and see the lyrics.  Connected to my echo dot I enjoy listening in multiple rooms.	1
975	Love Alexa!!  I own 2 and gave one for a gift which was a huge hit!	1
976	The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  	1
977	It was horrible!.	0
978	Very puny sound, but works great.	1
979	The battery is completely useless to me.	0
980	We now have a dot, spot, echo and show and love the show and spot best. The show has great sound and my wife loves the display for weather, recipes and sing alongside. Super deal.	1
981	Keep up the good work Amazon!!	1
982	We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.	1
983	amazon fire stick is amazing !!!	1
984	I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good.	1
985	I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.	1
986	My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	0
987	The commands Alexa requires are too specific.  I find Google home to be much more flexible in figuring out what I'm asking for.	1
988	As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  	1
989	The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	1
990	Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use...	1
991	you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool.	1
992	Entertainment	1
993	"""During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my """"smart"""" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!"""	1
994	I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.	1
995	Fun to use, good sound quality	1
996	"""If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of """"The Way You Look Tonight""""), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  """	1
997	Having trouble with volume.	0
998	I like everything about it !!!	1
999	Extremely low in volume	0
1000	I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.	0
1001	Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker	1
1002	Great addition to our Alexa family. Great video also.	1
1003	Yes it met my expectations.  The snooze on the alarm needs a but of work.  Tap it and it snoozes, swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss.  But without my glasses I can't read it and often it just snoozes.  Then one day I must have dismissed tomorrow's alarm because it never went off.  I have it set for Mon-Thu.  Fri I don't need to get up early.  A more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice.  My old alarm had a red light.	1
1004	I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did.	1
1005	5 stars for the brick oven bread app!	1
1006	Great device, I'm cutting my cable and watching the channels I want. If I want to add an app like CBS I can just pay a little extra and get it.	1
1007	Very good	1
1008	The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  	0
1009	We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	1
1010	Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.	1
1011	Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!	1
1012	I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.	1
1013	Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.	1
1014	I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	0
1015	For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  	1
1016	It does not speak in Spanish,,,I bought it for my grandmother to have someone to talk to when I‚Äôm not around,,,,,no Spanish!	0
1017	This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	1
1018	Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.	0
1019	Sauce was tasteless.	0
1020	Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  	1
1021	What a great little gadget for the house. You ask and it delivers, period. Well done!	1
1022	I like the echo show its the best! big screen you can watch movies preview from the movie and alexa will answer all your question you name it.	1
1023	Great sound and the screen is nice to actually see time, trivia, etc.	1
1024	The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.	0
1025	I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  	0
1026	Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  	0
1027	I have had no problems with my Echo Plus. Would purchase it again.	1
1028	Have had an larger echo for some time and love it. Bought this one for another portion of the house since we have several wifi home devices and we wanted to voice control them from all over the house.	1
1029	Primarily for music in our bedroom.  I wish the speaker had better fidelity.	1
1030	And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  	0
1031	daughter wanted a white boombox, nothing good out for 11 yr old.  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white BT good speaker.  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet.	1
1032	Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.	0
1033	Excellent. Bought another one yesterday!	1
1034	Great to play music throughout the house. Great and easily fits in my decor of my home	1
1035	The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	1
1036	Clear screen and great picture	1
1037	Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.	1
1038	Love my spot! My favorite feature is the &#34;Alexa, start my day.&#34; I love that I can hear the weather, traffic and even the word of the day! It even goes right into my favorite podcast while I get dressed!	1
1039	The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	0
1040	It‚Äôs awesome	1
1041	I could not recommend these more.	0
1042	You need a Harvard law degree to operate this thing! It's going back very soon!	0
1043	Works like a charm!	1
1044	I got this for dad on father's Day!  He was tickled with it!	1
1045	We‚Äôve had the original Echo for quite some time and just recently added the Show.  It was simple to setup and more inviting to use with the visual interface.  The Echo is being used as the primary interface for my connected home system which is currently only controlling lights and switches.  I look forward to expanding on that capability.  We also use it for maintaining lists, as a music player, general information, and entertainment.  I haven‚Äôt used the Show to shuffle through our favorite  photographs but will start that soon.	1
1046	Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.	0
1047	Woa, talk about awful.  	0
1048	The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.	0
1049	The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	1
1050	The service was not up to par, either.	0
1051	The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.	1
1052	Very satisfied with the product	1
1053	For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn‚Äôt know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don‚Äôt. Lastly, I‚Äôm sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù.	0
1054	All the bread is made in-house!	1
1055	Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  	0
1056	I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!	1
1057	So awesome to bring my older tv to life	1
1058	Nice product but as intelligent as we thought or had hoped.	1
1059	The staff are also very friendly and efficient.	1
1060	Took a little work to set up but I finally got it.  Sound quality not the best but for what I got it for it works great.  I check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it.  I do play the radio on it when I want some music but will probably upgrade to the Echo plus for better sound.	1
1061	Easy setup. Alexa needs a lot of training,	1
1062	I have been waiting for the Echo Show to go on sale and it was worth the wait. It was easy to set up and start using	1
1063	Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	0
1064	Alarm, calendar, reminders	1
1065	How can you not like the Echo Plus.  It has the built in Hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices.  Amazon makes a great product and I haven't had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices (echo dots, etc.).	1
1066	I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	0
1067	I'm finding more and more uses for this all the time. It keeps me informed with news and weather, I can get a daily Bible verse, and have it play music. New skills are added all the time. The future is here!	1
1068	Will not be back!	0
1069	Love the speakers and the screen.	1
1070	Doesn't use apple music.  It is worthless to me without it.  Sound quality on it is also poor.	0
1071	After purchasing my Echo Spot to add to our other 4 Amazon Echoes...I am very pleased with the Echo Spot...I use  it with our Arlo Security cameras and Ring video doorbell and works without any problems...	1
1072	We held off purchasing an Echo but couldn't resist during Prime Days.  The Echo works great and it's nice to have the screen.  There is still a lot more we need to learn how to do.	1
1073	My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	1
1074	Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.	1
1075	We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.	1
1076	The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	1
1077	Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	1
1078	I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  	1
1079	But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0
1080	nice leather.	1
1081	Perfect	1
1082	Easy to use, Answers all my questions,Hands free, What's not to like , It may not be perfect but it is  a sign of the times to come, can be connected to smart home items, I enjoy it totallly,, Keeps your home connected	1
1083	Echos are great I have a few of them through out our home .  All in voice range to ask a question. Say a command to turn lights on or off. Or my favorite is play music all though the house.	1
1084	Purchased this for a discount on Prime Day to insert into a portable Bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with Echo Dot. Works great, love it! Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!	1
1085	works great	1
1086	LOVE!	1
1087	I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol	1
1088	He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	0
1089	The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.	1
1090	Easy to set-up and to use.	1
1091	I love it. It is compatible with many of my cameras and it does everything that the echo dot does.	1
1092	I love it it is awesome	1
1093	The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0
1094	Easy to set up and start using.. works as advertised.	1
1095	WORTHWHILE.	1
1096	Fun	1
1097	Love Echo, everywhere I go in my house she's always reminding me, playing music or talking to me.  Love her.	1
1098	Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
1099	Doubtful at first, but it works a lot better than my smart devices.Plus Alexa software include, that was a plus!	1
1100	The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
1101	This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  	1
1102	I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.	0
1103	REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
1104	I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.	1
1105	Not a good bargain.	0
1106	Not good for the money.	0
1107	Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.	1
1108	Good Quality.	1
1109	These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.	1
1110	Use the product for music and it‚Äôs great!	1
1111	Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  	0
1112	Get this in white. I bought it for my girlfriend in white and I wish I had it in white now. Alexa is one of those devices you will always use and miss when it's not around. I find new uses for Alexa every day. I've Incorporated this device into so many parts of my daily life. As Alexa learns more I learn more. She's my alarm clock, she reminds me of important dates. I'm constantly asking her for information like travel, entertainment, science, history, politics Etc. She turns on and off lights, she's the core of my smart home.	1
1113	Worked just like a brand new Dot ---so I am very satisfied.	1
1114	The best phone in market :).	1
1115	We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price.	1
1116	It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.	1
1117	But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  	0
1118	It was so BORING!  	0
1119	Great deal, great product!	1
1120	Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  	1

1126	"""But now that it is """"out of warranty"""" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it."""	0
1127	I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.	1
1128	Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  	1
1129	There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  	0
1130	I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.	0
1131	The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	0
1132	The alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work. I was not aware of that.  Disappointed	0
1133	I am guilty of not setting this up, I had my youngest daughter do it. She did not seem to have much trouble figuring it out. So I would have to assume it was not very difficult. I have not tried to use it  yet but my oldest seems to like it so she ordered one for herself.	1
1134	Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.	1
1135	The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  	0
1136	I like everything, about this ! Im still learning how to use it!	1
1137	I love my Alexa Dot. I play games with my son, ask how the weather Is and I love that she works with my Amazon Fire Tv.	1
1138	Amazon doesn't disappoint.	1
1139	I like that it respond most of my comands. Great product.	1

1145	Excellent short film.  	1
1146	Great to have along with the Echo	1
1147	If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  	1
1148	I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music.	1
1149	I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.	0
1150	Really like it	1
1151	Love it! It's everything I wanted and more	1
1152	Still getting used to Alexa, don't have her connected to our TV yet or other things right now use her for music and information, which she is great!!	1
1153	The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.	1
1154	I've only had this a week but so far so good.  We are enjoying it.	1
1155	I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.	1
1156	I loved everything about this item. Quick response time and very sensitive to me speaking from the other end of the house.	1
1157	Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
1158	Cool	1
1159	Refurbished is the way to go. My Echo works just like new.	1
1160	I love that you can watch Bob Dylan‚Äôs movies	1
1161	Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  	1
1162	Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  	0
1163	Loved it. No more cable bills for us.  I would advise anyone to get one. 2nd one bought.	1
1164	Was loving it but starting in June Hulu stopped working and crunchyroll doesn‚Äôt work either. Probably will switch to something else soon.	0
1165	The battery works great!	1
1166	As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.	1
1167	Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.	0
1168	This was like the final blow!	0
1169	I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!	1
1170	Works great and easy to set up!	1
1171	I bought two of them and neither will charge.	0
1172	Thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. Not much better than the Echo dot. Not worth the money.	0
1173	I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.	0
1174	It plays music that I request.	1
1175	In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  	1
1176	Love it. Small with good sound	1
1177	We haven‚Äôt used it much yet.  We like what we have used. My husband loves it.	1
1178	I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!	1
1179	Easy to Install. Very clear speaker. I took one star off because it was delivered late by OnTrac-like usual.	1
1180	The echo part works fine.  The hue hub is a disaster.  It worked for a few months and then nothing.  I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one =y to have to send it in for repair.  I am now trying to reconnect my lights.  What a pain.  I am having to reset each light bulb.  It can take up to 5 times to get it to reset.  I have spent hours on this.  I will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful.  Stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps.	0
1181	I love it but does not play well with my Amazon Prime... many shortcomings and potential fees	1
1182	This is very hard to review because I am part of the  problem.I am 75 and got it so my dog would have distracting noise when I am not home.I am computer literate, iTunes literate, Amazon literate, as well as countless other programs, but am apparently a dunce when it comes to talking to Alexa.  I think I heard her sigh in exasperation.I tried to create a playlist of songs I like only to have it ignored.  I am learning workarounds but they are mediocre, at best...and, as yet do not include a personal playlist.I have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic Alexa than am I.So far, I like what I have been able to use but I'd like it a lot more if I could configure it to my needs, rather than accepting the Amazon/Alexa default.Karen	1
1183	The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	0
1184	Kids like it for games.  Showing the lyrics for songs is neat.	1
1185	The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	0
1186	Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound.	1
1187	It‚Äôs a great product and easily set up just have to get it in sync with your personal set up	1
1188	It‚Äôs awesome	1
1189	Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.	1
1190	As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.	1
1191	Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  	1
1192	So far we have enjoyed it.  The only problem we have is I have not been able to call one of my sons with it (the sad part is he is the one who gave it to me:( )	1
1193	It is very easy to use,I can now watch my favorite movies	1
1194	The speakers on these devices are surprisingly good. The functionality of each echo device is fantastic.	1
1195	Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.	0
1196	Give this one a look.  	1
1197	doesn't last long.	0
1198	Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  	0
1199	Sending it back.	0
1200	Love it!  We have other echoes and love those so I bought this on prime day!  No regrets.  Love that I can connect to my Ring and see the front door.  Yhe kids like seeing the lyrics to songs and sing along. .	1
1201	Let‚Äôs start with.Dislikes: Now I want to buy 7 more to have them all over my house.Do I even need to add my likes now? HahaAwesome fun and useful. Nothing else to say.	1
1202	I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!	1
1203	They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  	1
1204	Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house	1
1205	The noise shield is incrediable.	1
1206	It was quite comfortable in the ear.	1
1207	But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  	1
1208	Love it!  Great to request music and be able to see lyrics.  I had a dot, but this is so much better.	1
1209	I didn‚Äôt order it	0
1210	You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.	0
1211	The rest of the cast also play well.  	1
1212	Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.	1
1213	Really like it	1
1214	I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	1
1215	It was very easy to set up and my family love it‚Äôs!	1
1216	I gave it a 10  	1
1217	Some times Alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!	1
1218	I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.	0
1219	I liked this movie way too much.  	1
1220	Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory	0
1221	Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.	1
1222	Worked as promised.	1
1223	The service was terrible, food was mediocre.	0
1224	It does everything the Echo does, and more. Although I haven't and probably won't use the video functions. I had hoped that the display would be allow for more customization. It does not and is very limited. I would like the clock and weather to display in large text all of the time, it only displays in very small text. It also always has a line that says &#34;Tell Alexa to do this, or that&#34;, tips at the bottom of the screen. I would like to see that go away, but it won't. Sound quality is good, not as good as the big Echo, but good enough. I bought it on sale and think I got value for what I paid. I would have been disappointment had I of paid full price.	1
1225	I like the volume up and down on the top so I can turn it down quickly.	1
1226	Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  	0
1227	Love our Fire Stick,easy to set up and have loads of shows for free and plenty to rent or buy.We also use Pluto TV and Tubi so that's even more TV.Alexa makes it so easy to find any show or movie I want.We love the money we save.	1
1228	I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.	1
1229	"""I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a """"smart home"""". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!"""	1
1230	Works for me.	1

1238	-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0
1239	Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
1240	Overall I like this. Though Siri on my phone can do more for what I need as I don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù and don‚Äôt intend to make it one. But it‚Äôs fun and I use it for music and to have it read me my audible books.	1
1241	Earbud piece breaks easily.	0
1242	Item no longer works after just 5 months of use. Will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests.	0
1243	Love it	1
1244	Glad I bought this.	1
1245	Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.	1
1246	Amazing device	1
1247	Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.It‚Äôs far from being useful.Half the time when you ‚Äúwake‚Äù the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn‚Äôt hear what you say and turns off. Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It‚Äôs been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I‚Äôm past the return period...... zzzz	0
1248	very nice-needs some work	1
1249	Love this just wish it had a built in hub	1
1250	Still haven‚Äôt learn all the Echo can do, but so far, quite pleased!	1
1251	Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ	1
1252	We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!	1
1253	Amazing product	1
1254	Was working great √∫til 1 week algo, √≠ have it for a month, but it started flickering,  and in the support forums they say it is a known isue,  but it has more the 4 months reported and There is no soluci√≥n.	1
1255	Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	1
1256	By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0
1257	I would highly recommend this product.	1
1258	Not my thing.	0
1259	So far pretty happy with the Spot. For me it really is a glorified alarm clock/radio and I know I could have something more cost effective but eh, I like it. I had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did. So far so good.	1
1260	I like how small it is, but I‚Äôm still able to see my Ring cameras.	1
1261	Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won‚Äôt respond or says she doesn‚Äôt recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won‚Äôt respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it‚Äôs a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.	1
1262	My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions	1
1263	And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).	1
1264	LOVE .. LOVE my Echo Plus !  So silly simple to set up .  Alexa has now become my new BFF.  Amazon 24/7 Support is hard to beat !!  Any questions answered any time ... What more can you ask for !!!	1
1265	I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier	1
1266	The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  	0
1267	Love it!	1
1268	Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  	0
1269	When we were buying another product there was an option to bundle this one for an extra $30...so we thought why not? Well, I'm so glad we did! We are really enjoying our Echo Spot. It reads stories to our girls, plays music, gives us the news, and so much more!  It's so responsive and has so many skills that we enjoy.	1
1270	Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  	1
1271	Love my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker.  The return process still isn't done and has already taken weeks.	1
1272	Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.	1
1273	I bought this specifically for the smart hub capability. So far it has been great. Easy set up instructions for all the various brands compatible with it.	1
1274	"""Still, it was the SETS that got a big """"10"""" on my """"oy-vey"""" scale.  """	1
1275	Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn‚Äôt be happier!	1
1276	Does what I expected, and more.	1
1277	The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.	1
1278	Easy to install and operate. Works with Alexa voice commands.	1
1279	The sound quality is great, it now replace the echo dot in my kitchen.	1
1280	Worst customer service.	0
1281	The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  	1
1282	This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
1283	Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.	1
1284	dont go here.	0
1285	I love this so much!! Alexa is even better when she can show you things!	1
1286	Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1
1287	Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.	1
1288	Terrible product, and waste of money!	0
1289	Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs	1
1290	I do like the product we bought it on Prime day but this week it was $30 cheaper then Prime day. Still a really cool device. I wish I would have waited.	1
1291	***Love it***	1
1292	Crisp and Clear.	1
1293	I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  	0
1294	In a word, it is embarrassing.  	0
1295	GO AND SEE IT!  	1
1296	Echo Dot is a wonderful invention. We love it. Alexa is so smart.	1
1297	This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems	1
1298	I love it. It does everything.	1
1299	There is a brilliant twist ending.  	1
1300	Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  	1
1301	I loved it, it was really scary.  	1
1302	Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  	0
1303	I'm loving my new Echo Show. The video screen adds so much more value and potential. Movies, tv shows, song lyrics, all extra features that are available with the Echo Show. Oh, it also has a built in camera for taking pics.	1
1304	Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  	1
1305	It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.	1
1306	I really enjoyed Crema Caf√© before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.	1
1307	This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1
1308	Love it!! Don‚Äôt know what took me so long to get one ‚Äî and don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt get two on Amazon Prime Day!	1
1309	4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.	1
1310	Great to have along with the Echo	1
1311	Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.	1
1312	so far, so good, works great.	1
1313	Great buy. Recommend getting Kodi with some movie addons	1
1314	Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807.	0
1315	Great little thing. Works better than siri.	1
1316	The sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions	1
1317	It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
1318	Works and sounds great! My house is barely 1100sf, and I have this sitting on my kitchen counter. I can hear it, and speak to it from any room. Lots of functionality still to discover.	1
1319	Works good.  Microphone is not as good as the better Echo products	1
1320	I love it!  I especially love that it is so small and does so much.  Got rid of my old CD/Alarm clock radio.  Much more room on nightstand.	1
1321	The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  	1
1322	My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions	1
1323	Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  	1
1324	Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.	1
1325	the cast was great.  	1
1326	I'm obsessed with Alexa. She tells me the weather every morning, she can play games (we love the guess the song one!) and the one we have upstairs can turn off our TV downstairs which is so cool because why walk down the stairs if Alexa will do it for you????	1
1327	Clear music	1
1328	Love it. Though, wish it was portable.	1
1329	Hands free control	1
1330	Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	1
1331	Don‚Äôt use it for much as I thought we would. Synced with Kasa-Cam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot. Lyrics for music is cool, too. Other than that it‚Äôs used as a clock and standard dot‚Äôish features.	1
1332	Better than expected!	1
1333	Blue Ant is easy to use.	1
1334	Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.	1
1335	A good time!	1
1336	The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.	0
1337	So far all.i can say is I love it	1
1338	I Was Hoping for More.	0
1339	I really liked that.  	1
1340	The ase of participating with Echo	1
1341	So Far So Good!.	1
1342	I'm pleased.	1
1343	This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!	1
1344	Very good quality	1
1345	Plan on ordering from them again and again.	1
1346	LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!	1
1347	Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  	0
1348	As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  	1
1349	Simple set up.  Music everywhere.	1
1350	Is great having a new friend	1
1351	For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	0
1352	Plenty of options to choose from!	1
1353	It's AGGRAVATING!	0
1354	I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  	0
1355	Works. Replaced my expired bedside radio/alarm.It took me a while to realize that option setting involved using it as a touch screen.Maybe it should said something during the setup process.	1
1356	Family loved it!	1
1357	The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.	0
1358	I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.	1
1359	Love it!! Perfect for an alarm clock replacement, plus so much more!!	1
1360	It is so easy to use and is everything I hoped for	1
1361	I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0
1362	Battery life is real good.	1
1363	Avoid at all costs.  	0
1364	The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.	1
1365	We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.	1
1366	I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
1367	Definitely a bargain.	1
1368	Did take me about 6 hours to set it up I have a Galaxy S9 phone when I got used to the system setup it was in seconds edit my light bulbs adding a string of lights simple easy	1
1369	It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  	0
1370	There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0
1371	Works great!	1
1372	I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected	1
1373	It worked very well.	1
1374	Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0
1375	Easy setup with great sound, I would rate this unit a 10 +++++, and a must have for the office and home. l am looking add other devices (locks, and lights) for my home.	1
1376	Love the TV/movie selection. I really like the fact that I can just rent a movie if they don't have it in their selection.	1
1377	Great pork sandwich.	1
1378	Sounds great!! Love them!	1
1379	Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.	1
1380	Still needs some work on commands. Sound is equal in the regular echo so if you don't need a smart hub get a regular echo. The sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but I mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear.	1
1381	Bought two of them and both work great. I'm not much on electronics running my home, but Alexa does all that I want and need to be done.	1
1382	An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  	1
1383	Battery life is also great!	1
1384	Very intrusive, so I turn it off	0
1385	I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.	1
1386	Didnt think id get an Alexa device, but this is perfect for my home office.  the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other Alexa devices.  It can show lyrics of songs, play my xm radio, can show videos of movie trailers and news.  Its great!	1
1387	This place lacked style!!	0
1388	It's like having another kid in the house; I have to constantly repeat myself.I can tell Alexa to do something clear as day, and according to the history, she hears something comeletely different.The device is really cool, and I like the concept, which is why it gets two stars. However, it just doesn't work as intended.I find myself irritated more often than not when I use this device.	0
1389	I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can't do.  It works well.	1
1390	A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  	1
1391	The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  	1
1392	Have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great	1
1393	We are a long time Amazon Prime family, many years, but new to the Alexa world and thought the purchase of Alexa Plus, with hub, and included Phillips Hue light bulb would be a great start. Alexa does a lot of good things for us like Alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, but not Bose. But, the ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. Well, not so. I understand there will be some differences in product device  support. The fact that it came with the Hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. The bulb is capable of so much more with the Hue App but the Hue app does not recognize Alexa hub as a bridge. So, it appears you do have to get a Philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. That can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. The list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. Was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point I feel we are being misled by Amazon by included the Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw a good discount my way to get the Hue bridge if I keep the Echo Plus before I invest in more light bulbs.	1
1394	Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	0
1395	So bad.  	0
1396	Still getting used to Alexa, but I think she's a keeper!	1
1397	Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	0
1398	Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  	1
1399	I can't get multiple profiles working. It just spins when adding a 2nd user at pass device prompt	1
1400	the best	1
1401	Everything was gross.	0
1402	Sad joke. Worthless.	0
1403	See both films if you can.  	1
1404	You can't beat the price on these.	1
1405	Although I haven't taken advantage of many of the Echo's features there is one that bothers me. It starts talking even when I haven't said anything even close to the wake up word - ECHO - had to change from Alexa due to a conflict with another device.	1
1406	However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  	1
1407	It,is,what it is and than some. Sounds great too. On,y thing I dont like the camera being seen by anyone working for amazon  I asked echo show to show me camera and didn‚Äôt know what I was saying but knows how to turn camera on and off but can‚Äôt dhiw u what‚Äôs recording hmm	1
1408	Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  	0
1409	AMAZING. It has helped me become better organized, gives me traffic updates, weather updates, and helps me maintain a good, fast morning routine.	1
1410	Works perfectly	1
1411	Well behaved device that i enjoy using.	1
1412	Still leaning about it. The price was right!	1
1413	I wish it did more with internet searches.  I do like the feature it has	1
1414	I was very disappointed in the movie.  	0
1415	I like it and it‚Äôs helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.	1
1416	It was smaller than I had anticipated, and when I say that I very much mean it. However, it still works very well! Quality sound, easily programmed, easy to work with, but Alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs.	1
1417	Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.	1
1418	Definitely a really good buy for FIRST time buyers of smart home stuff =]I bought 3 =]	1
1419	Absolutely love it	1
1420	It worked like a brandnew unit! Great addition to my collection.	1
1421	I have been through 4 Shows now.  And ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN BROKEN.  It has been anything from screens that lose lines of resolution to timers and reminders going off an hour late or reminders that trigger when trying to set other reminders.  I don't have these issues on my Dot or my Echo.  Just on the Show.  It would be nice if Amazon could get there act together and actually fix this thing.	0
1422	Barry	1
1423	We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.	1
1424	It's great sound and video quality	1
1425	Very capable.  Language recognition is the best I've experienced.  Great sound, too!	1
1426	Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!	1
1427	She doesn‚Äôt always listen	1
1428	And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	1
1429	I like it and still learning how to use it.	1
1430	What the hell kind of crap is that?!  	0
1431	Very Good to be able to listen to Every single song at any time in Amazon's vast library. We're only just beginning to know everything Echo Show has to offer. Well worth the price!! Alexa is very helpful.	1
1432	Son loves it.	1
1433	Amazing for all your entertainment needs!	1
1434	don't waste your money.	0
1435	It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  	0

1437	The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0
1438	Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  	0
1439	I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we‚Äôll keep it..	1

1446	Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it‚Äôs great that I was able to set that as default. There‚Äôs not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He‚Äôs a lot more calmer and doesn‚Äôt bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It‚Äôs a must have!	1
1447	Easy to set up. Plug it in then make some selections for your preferences such as language, temp C or F etc. I am getting more familiar with it and will be adding my calendar and appointments.	1

1451	I will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible. With my lifetime Amazon spending approaching nearly $40,000, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm just a small customer to them, but I‚Äôve rarely been so disappointed out of hundreds if not thousands of Amazon purchases.I have 8+ echos for home automation and bought this Echo Plus specifically for the built-in hub along with approximately $600+ in zigbee light switches. The voice control is subpar even when it works, and that is a rarity. Most often it does nothing. I could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the Amazon/Zigbee ecosystem. If you value your money, and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere	0

1458	Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.	1
1459	It works just as well as the new version I got as a discount with my Echo speaker. I decided to purchase this version because Amazon states it has the same warranty.	1
1460	Definitely worth checking out.  	1

1466	this is my 2nd echo dot and it is working just as i want it to.  i have it in the bedroom and i par it with a small blue tooth speaker.  last nite i went to sleep with sounds of a thunderstorm as provided by my echo dot.  i am planning to have the dot turn my bedroom lamps on when i receive the smart plugs that i ordered.	1
1467	We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	1
1468	Now I'm weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  I have 3-4, so this is very concerning.  I wish Amazon would release something widespread  or push some firmware to prevent this.  If they have, I have not heard about it yet.	0

1473	Alexa is the best smart speaker out there I'm so glad I came across it the sound is so amazing and I mostly use Amazon Alexa for music and school work help I love to control my room lights and the color totally recommend	1
1474	I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)	1
1475	I love these, I have 2 dots and one echo. For a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although I do use external for the dots.	1
1476	The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.	1
1477	Just like it's big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room.	1
1478	Its a total package.	1

1484	At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  	1
1485	The refurbished echo for has been wonderful. I purchased this for my mother. She loves the ability to contact me without a phone, listen to music, weather, and ask questions. It's been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems	1

1494	Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  	0
1495	Not perfect but very good! A few times Alexa picked up something from TV, and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things. If you call something &#34;light&#34; in the app you need to say light, not &#34;lights.&#34; Echo Plus has no problems as a smart hub but I could use better user directions. Well worth owning and a good step to making my home Smart!	1
1496	Great	1
1497	Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  	0
1498	The sound quality is really quite good. I also have a Dot which is Bluetooth linked to a Grace Digital amplifier which is driving a couple of floor standing Snell speakers, obvious the floor standing speakers are better than this but not by much. My only complaint is that you can't customize Alexa hot words. Now that I have multiple Alexa devices there needs to be a way to direct an Alexa command to a particular device. I would like to be able to talk to a device by name.	1
1499	Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0

1519	It even has its sweet moments.  	1
1520	Great brunch spot.	1
1521	I'm finding more and more uses for this all the time. It keeps me informed with news and weather, I can get a daily Bible verse, and have it play music. New skills are added all the time. The future is here!	1
1522	I got it to try side by side with the Echo originale. They are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. As many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the Philips Hue, Z wave or anything else. It provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. For me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original Echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. The new Echo plus is priced lower than the original Echo with the built in hub but I don't really need the hub with less functionality. In addition, I don't think that Amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs FW and they fixes bugs. Net net for me, this Echo does not do anything more than the original Echo and sound quality is not as good. With the  original Echo available as refurbished I would check that out first before considering this or the new Echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.	1

1542	My wife has been using Skype for years to talk to her parents daily, with constant technical issues.  Since her father is 88, it's a lot to ask the man to uninstall/reinstall/reconfigure Skype, but he does.  When I saw these on sale, I jumped on them.  My wife was resistant to &#34;learn a new technology&#34;, but I told her these just work - like the video phones I saw at the New York World's Fair in 1964 - 54 years ago!Yesterday it set up quickly and worked fine, with no issues.  My wife told her co-worker today and she went out and bought 3 - one for herself and her husband, and one for each set of parents.  It just works, like a telephone - imagine that.	1
1543	Product does not.  Light bar never went orange.  I googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions. I tried both.  Product is defective	0

1552	A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  	0

1585	:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  	1
1586	I own the first and second generation Echo Dot.  I think I prefer the volume ring of the first gen better than the buttons on the second gen, but still more than does the job and great for the price I got it for.  I'd still definitely recommend.	1
1587	Had to return it as Hulu does not work on device.  It kept coming up with errors, and Hulu app not being able to open at times.  It was hit and miss, and at times, Hulu will stop working right in the middle of a show or movie.  Plus fire stick is very slow in opening the apps.	0

1616	Our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full-fledged tablet.  What fantastic potential these have - for digital photo screen, video calls, easy accesss to music, audio books, etc. However, once we have them setup, we discovered the huge lurking negative.  Amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their Alexa features.  You can turn off many other things in settins, but you cannot turn off &#34;Things to Try&#34;.  Instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time ... we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says, &#34;Try ......&#34;.

Then the echo dot downstairs starting singing ‚Äúoh technology oh technology‚Äù kind of weird but it seems to have a mind of its own.	1
1634	How easy if was to set up.	1

1644	I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.	0
1645	Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.	1
1646	I‚Äôm having trouble with it, the alarm most of times doesn‚Äôt work, the timer doesn‚Äôt ends... and Alexa keeps saying she is unavailable.	1

1665	Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated.	1
1666	Love it!	1
1667	Stopped working after 7 months. The warranty was only good for 3 months. I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?	0
1668	We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.	1
1669	It isn‚Äôt bad for what it is. Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it‚Äôs not bad for the sale price I paid.	1
1670	I have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole. Completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock. It is the perfect bedside counter device - alarm, wake up music, weather, top news stories, etc. Perfect device for what I wanted and does so much more than I expected it to do, calling feature is also a huge selling point. This is a must own item. Probably will grab more Echos in the future.	1
1671	I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting.	1

1675	Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.	1
1676	"""like the other reviewer said """"you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""""""	0
1677	We love this.	1
1678	This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.	0
1679	Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.	0
1680	Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1
1681	I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	1
1682	I'd love to go back.	1
1683	Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  	1
1684	Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en espa√±ol.	1
1685	Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.	1
1686	Bought this on Prime day	1
1687	I really love this item!  So much fun!	1
1688	I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  	1
1689	Love this!	1
1690	In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  	0
1691	I love Alexa!	1
1692	Easy setup and sound quality.	1
1693	Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.	1
1694	The inside is really quite nice and very clean.	1
1695	This was an add on for my echo system, the refurbished product works like new!	1
1696	Love it!  So do the grandkids!!	1
1697	AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	0
1698	Ordered 2 on deal day. 1 doesn‚Äôt work and 2 nd just went down after 2 days üòè	0
1699	The portion was huge!	1
1700	The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  	0
1701	Terrific sound for a small device, and nice form factor for the nightstand. I like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking Alexa. Not using video much, but it would be nice if the device had a square/rectangular screen.	1
1702	Love it! I‚Äôve listened to songs I haven‚Äôt heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It‚Äôs great!	1
1703	The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  	1
1704	Great product but returning for new Alexa Dot.  Refurbished is already giving me problems with connection.	0
1705	Haven't had it a week and already it cannot connect to my network. Tried reconnecting manually and the echo never appears in the list of devices to connect. It will be on it's way back to Amazon	0
1706	It's Alexa.... what else can you say	1
1707	Nice little unit  no issues	1
1708	Works great.	1
1709	High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.	1
1710	The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	0
1711	I love it!!	1
1712	I have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it. I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I'm learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied. Will be buying one for my mother and one for my office.	1
1713	It‚Äôs great	1
1714	Blue light blinks all the time	1
1715	I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	0
1716	Given as a gift to my wife, to compliment my echo.  She loves it.	1
1717	Holy sound quality batman! This thing jams. It's insanely helpful and just a nice gadget to have around.	1
1718	Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.	1
1719	Love the echo show. The video quality is good and of course sound is good too.	1
1720	The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.	1
1721	saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less, because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected.	1
1722	"""During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my """"smart"""" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!"""	1
1723	Highly entertaining at all angles.  	1
1724	Its not user friendly.	0
1725	Exactly what I wanted with speedy shipping.....thank you so much!	1
1726	Plug n Play set up is simple. Added battery base to make it portable. Looking forward to using the hub.	1
1727	This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  	1
1728	A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
1729	Works like a charm.	1
1730	Great product. More skills are needed. I love it.	1
1731	Basically the service was very bad.	0
1732	Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.	0
1733	Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use...	1
1734	Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated.	1
1735	This is pretty cool	1
1736	Amazon Music is great. Love the ability to create my only playlists. Has great sound, not up to the standard of our Bose but very good.	1
1737	Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!	1
1738	Love this just wish it had a built in hub	1
1739	The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.	1
1740	I never had ALEXA before but the biggest reason I bought it was for YOUTUBE and apparently YOUTUBE stopped supporting it and that is why it will get 4 stars.... it's mostly YOUTUBE's FAULT but I worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist	1
1741	Lame would be the best way to describe it.  	0
1742	This is such a fun and funny movie.  	1
1743	Good as new!! Just like brand new! Save yourself some money. Get one!	1
1744	Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good	1
1745	From such a small speaker it sounds great	1
1746	This thing woke me up in the middle of the night saying ‚Äúready for setup‚Äù. It was already setup. Should be a simple thing to check  time before asking. Wife not happy...	0
1747	I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).	0
1748	I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.	0
1749	Improper description.... I had to return it.	0
1750	Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!	1
1751	Talk about USELESS customer service.	0
1752	I bought this fire stick for another TV! No more arguments about what to watch!	1
1753	There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
1754	- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1
1755	It was supposed to come with a free Hue lightbulb on Amazon Prime Day.  No light bulb arrived.  False advertising!	0
1756	Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	1
1757	I won't be back.	0
1758	At a volume setting of half or less, the speaker sounds like there is something rattling, crackling or vibrating in it.  I'd understand if the volume was set higher.  All speakers get distorted when over-driven.  But this doesn't sound like this is an over-driven case; sounds like more of a rattle/crackle.  Possibly because the bass is too high.  Learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics (other than volume).  I will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem.	0
1759	I really like this item. I already had the echo dot but with this purchase the Philips Hue bulb came with the plus. Just purchasing the plus I have not had time to use it to its full capabilities but the bulb is something else. I use that with the echo dot to turn on our bedroom light and I really like it. The plus is in our great room/kitchen area. So far I give this a 5 star.	1
1760	Extremely easy to use! Switched away from directv and use it to stream T.V.	1
1761	don't waste your money and time.	0
1762	My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.	1
1763	It‚Äôs great but sound quality is very low	1
1764	Wish volume was capable of going louder	1
1765	Works great to control the TV lights and various other devices. Lately I've been using it when i wake up and don't know what time it is but don't want to open my eyes. Just shout out &#34;Alexa, What time is it?&#34; if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it'd be golden! sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect. The Echo Plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive Echo.	1
1766	Menu doesn‚Äôt work. Says it can‚Äôt connect to amazon network	0
1767	Love these.  Great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  Or listen to CNN live with Serius SM.	1
1768	What a mistake that was!	0
1769	It does what it's suppose to do great product.	1
1770	No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify ‚Äúplus/prime/etc‚Äù account.  So you must pay to play ‚Äúyour‚Äù music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is üëçüèª .	1
1771	Exchange new color	1
1772	I love it and it works great, the only issue is the ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù FaceTime like feature sometimes lags, but that could possibly be an issue with my WiFi for where we have it located in the house.	1
1773	The BT headset was such a disapoinment.	0
1774	Very good food, great atmosphere.1	1
1775	I love it!	1
1776	This is my second one. I have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home office.It is amazing for a quick look up while I am working. I live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointments.I will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family. The gift of organization and information at a voice command away.	1
1777	I'm not eating here!	0
1778	An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	1
1779	Does everything I need!	1
1780	Love	1
1781	This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.	1
1782	Simple install and love the voice activation	1
1783	I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	0
1784	This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	1
1785	We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	0
1786	Used twice not working!!!!!!!	0
1787	Superb Phone on a Great Network.	1
1788	Very nicely constructed. My wife wanted a second for the kitchen so I order a second one.	1
1789	I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.	1
1790	the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!	0
1791	It was perfect.  Works like a charm.	1
1792	Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.	1
1793	Great product and easy to use	1
1794	Amazing!	1
1795	Fun and  information.  No dislikes  so far !! Like the convenience!!	1
1796	I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
1797	He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  	1
1798	Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	0
1799	Food was below average.	0
1800	There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  	0
1801	Very good quality though	1
1802	Mediocre food.	0
1803	Works good for the most part. You ask it some questions and she says she doesn‚Äôt know. I thought she was supposed to know everything	1
1804	This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  	0
1805	I like it	1
1806	Very helpful with daily activities	1
1807	Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	0
1808	The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.	1
1809	I loved it does exactly what it says	1
1810	Works great, speed is fast. Exactly what we needed	1
1811	Love it	1
1812	No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.	1
1813	The cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist.	1
1814	VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.	0
1815	I am not tec smart enough to make it work at all. Will send it back if I cant get help. My eco dot works just fine. this is too complacated.I just wanted a bigger speaker.	0
1816	No enough video options	1
1817	But then they came back cold.	0
1818	Echo Show is said to work with certain apps but,NOT!!! Cozi state works with Echo Show, but the Cozi Family‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt very well, Amazon needs to go back to drawing board, it would be such a needed piece of technology, but it lacks the essential, please fix. Cost of the Echo Show was  marvelous . Got Echo Show to take on shopping list but that is all so far, adding items to list has long lag, and it not my router being slow, my provider speed is !GB, speed not a problem, but before new items is updated on Cozi is very slow. Help is needed to get it updated to A1 working conditioning.	0
1819	Had a dot and upgraded to this! I like it. My only complaint is the very short instructions	1
