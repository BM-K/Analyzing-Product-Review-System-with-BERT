15	The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  	0

26	The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1

103	It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  	0
104	The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
105	I don't like this Nokia either.	0

115	Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  	0
116	Needless to say, I wasted my money.	0
117	The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  	0
118	This is not movie-making.  	0
119	By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0

145	Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
146	Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	0

154	The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  	0
155	I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	0
156	1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  	0
157	It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  	1
158	I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	0
159	It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.	0
160	The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.	1
161	But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  	0
162	This place lacked style!!	0
163	I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.	1
164	The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	1

166	At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0
167	Even worse than Ticker!  	0

188	CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.	1
189	Service is friendly and inviting.	1
190	I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.	0
191	It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
192	I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.	1
193	A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  	0
194	Having trouble with volume.	0
195	In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
196	There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  	0
197	Absolutel junk.	0
198	2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	0
199	The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	0
200	The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	0
201	My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	1
202	All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
203	I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.	0
204	Would not reccommend.	0
205	the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.	0
206	Low Quality.	0
207	This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
208	This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.	1
209	There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.	0
210	Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0
211	Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  	0
212	Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  	1
213	It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	1
214	Everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
215	It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.	1
216	The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.	1
217	I really liked that.  	1
218	It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.	1
219	Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  	0
220	I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	0
221	Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  	1
222	The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  	0
223	Even the squibs look awful.  	0
224	Setup went very smoothly.	1
225	Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	0
226	We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.	1
227	I was seated immediately.	1
228	The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  	1
229	Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	1
230	If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  	1
231	This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	1

233	Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  	1
234	This film offers many delights and surprises.  	1
235	We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0
236	I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  	1
237	I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
238	Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0
239	Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1
240	There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1
241	This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  	1
242	I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  	0
243	The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  	0
244	Excellent dual-purpose headset.	1
245	If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.	0

247	Better than expected.	1

251	We won't be returning.	0
252	It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.	0
253	The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0
254	It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  	1

256	Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!	0

259	I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  	0
260	Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  	0

262	Terrible product, and waste of money!	0
263	I'm pleased.	1
264	On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	0
265	They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.	1
266	The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.	0
267	There was hardly any meat.	0
268	It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.	1
269	Awesome selection of beer.	1
270	I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  	1
271	The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  	0
272	None of it works, just don't buy it.	0
273	Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0
274	It is a joy to use.	1
275	Waiter was a jerk.	0
276	However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  	0
277	Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  	1
278	He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  	0
279	Good Service-check!	1
280	But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  	0
281	Very happy with this product.	1
282	It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  	1

287	add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  	1
288	Nothing new there.  	0
289	The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.	1
290	I own 2 of these cases and would order another.	1
291	I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.	0
292	The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.	1
293	poor voice clarity.	0
294	It has all the features I want	1
295	I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.	0
296	The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  	0
297	From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	1
298	Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.	0
299	I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  	1
300	However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  	1
301	Brilliant!  	1
302	"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."	0
303	1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.	0
304	Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(	0
305	You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  	1
306	We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
307	He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
308	At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  	0
309	I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.	0
310	I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	1
311	These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.	1

316	I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.	1
317	Highly entertaining at all angles.  	1
318	This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  	1
319	Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	0
320	Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1
321	The price is reasonable and the service is great.	1
322	Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).	0
323	Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.	0
324	It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.	1
325	Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  	0

655	Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  	1
656	Lange had become a great actress.  	1

665	Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  	1
666	I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	1
667	much better than the hard plastic cases.	1
668	When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  	1
669	It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	0
670	I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.	1

672	This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!	0
673	He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  	0
674	We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
675	I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  	1
676	It looked like a wonderful story.  	1
677	All three broke within two months of use.	0
678	I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0
679	The service was terrible though.	0

681	A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  	1
682	It's AGGRAVATING!	0
683	Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  	0
684	Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  	1
685	Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  	1
686	My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.	1
687	It was pretty gross!	0
688	Predictable, but not a bad watch.  	1
689	Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	1
690	It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.	0
691	It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  	1
692	After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	0

722	Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  	0
723	The film looks cheap and bland.  	0
724	This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.	0

727	I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	1
728	Highly recommended A+  	1
729	All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	1
730	It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.	0
731	I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.	0
732	It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.	1
733	It just blew.  	0

736	Great place fo take out or eat in.	1
737	I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.	1
738	The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.	0

749	They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).	1
750	Love the margaritas, too!	1

752	The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	0
753	We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0
754	You won't regret it!	1
755	Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.	1
756	I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.	1
757	I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
758	Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.	1
759	So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.	0
760	It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).	0
761	This game rocks.  	1
762	I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	0
763	Disappointed!.	0
764	One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  	0
765	A great film by a great director.  	1
766	poor quality and service.	0
767	Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.	0
768	It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.	1
769	2 thumbs up to this seller	1
770	The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  	0
771	It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.	0
772	All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.	1
773	"The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the ""acting coach"" are fascinating.  "	1
774	Avoid at all costs.  	0
775	Could not get strong enough signal.	0
776	The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.	0
777	The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  	0
778	The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1
779	Last time buying from you.	0
780	The warm beer didn't help.	0
781	!I definitly recommend!!	1
782	Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  	1
783	The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  	1
784	The plug did not work very well.	0
785	however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.	0
786	Was not happy.	0
787	I've had better bagels from the grocery store.	0
788	first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  	0
789	Also the story and acting were weak.  	0
790	Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.	0
791	Will be back again!	1
792	This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.	0
793	And I just love the colors!	1
794	This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  	1
795	There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  	0
796	Better Than New.	1
797	It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.	1
798	This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  	0
799	I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.	0
800	i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.	0
801	This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  	0
802	dont buy it.	0
803	Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0
804	I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  	0
805	Give it a try, you will be happy you did.	1
806	- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1
807	I love this phone , It is very handy and has a lot of features .	1
808	On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1
809	SWEETEST PHONE!!!	1
810	As for the service, I thought it was good.	1
811	Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  	0
812	Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  	1
813	Damn good steak.	1
814	Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!	1
815	I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.	1
816	I'm trying to return it for a refund.	0
817	If you are reading this please don't go there.	0
818	I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	0
819	There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	0
820	The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0
821	"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."	0
822	Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	1
823	It will drive you barking mad!  	0
824	Tasted like dirt.	0
825	As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak.	0
826	We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	1
827	Always a pleasure dealing with him.	1
828	Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  	1
829	All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  	1
830	But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  	1
831	"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless."	0
832	I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	0
833	Big Disappointment with calendar sync.	0
834	After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.	0
835	I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
836	The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0
837	Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  	1
838	Fantastic food!	1
839	Very good stuff for the price.	1
840	Great Earpiece.	1
841	I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	0
842	The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
843	I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  	1
844	Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	0
845	AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.	0
846	It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	0
847	Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0
848	No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.	1
849	I could not recommend these more.	0
850	It was equally awful.	0
851	I was not impressed by this product.	0
852	After two I felt disgusting.	0
853	Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.	1
854	Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  	1
855	Good prices.	1
856	The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	1
857	I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  	1
858	It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.	1
859	Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  	0
860	We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0
861	Poor Construction.	0
862	We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0
863	All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  	0
864	The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  	0
865	I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	0
866	clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.	1
867	You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  	0
868	Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	0
869	I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  	0
870	I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.	1
871	Awful.  	0
872	The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1
873	It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  	1
874	Great for using with your home stereo.	1
875	Worst Thai ever.	0
876	I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0
877	I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
878	i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.	0
879	Horrible, horrible protector.	0
880	The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
881	The results, well, are a shame.  	0
882	They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	1
883	You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.	1
884	Just does not work.	0
885	The lead man is charisma-free.  	0
886	An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	1
887	Freezes frequently4.	0
888	Both great!	1
889	It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	1
890	It was also the right balance of war and love.  	1
891	The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1
892	You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.	0
893	Works good.	1
894	It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0
895	Great charger.	1
896	I'll be looking for a new earpiece.	0
897	When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!	1
898	REALLY UGLY.	0
899	It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  	1
900	The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  	0
901	This device is great in several situations:1.)	1
902	He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
903	The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.	1
904	This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
905	Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  	1
906	The service was a bit lacking.	0
907	On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.	1
908	The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0
909	This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  	1
910	Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0
911	The battery life is highly unacceptable.	0
912	You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
913	Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  	1
914	Reception is terrible and full of static.	0
915	I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.	1
916	A Disappointment.	0
917	Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	0
918	the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  	0
919	They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  	1
920	It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0
921	I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	1
922	Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.	1
923	Battery is terrible.	0
924	Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.	0
925	Won't ever go here again.	0
926	"You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."""	1
927	"The design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all."	0
928	The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.	1
929	THAT one didn't work either.	0
930	But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  	1
931	A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	1
932	All things considered, a job very well done.  	1
933	The food came out at a good pace.	1
934	A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
935	Must have been an off night at this place.	0
936	I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  	0
937	The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  	0
938	When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.	0
939	I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.	1
940	And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  	1
941	There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.	0
942	First of all, it doesn't wear well.	0
943	Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	1
944	Terrible management.	0
945	This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  	1
946	Hated it.  	0
947	But I don't like it.	0
948	Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.	1
949	However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  	0
950	did not like at all.	0
951	I hope this place sticks around.	1
952	Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  	0
953	Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  	1
954	The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.	0
955	The replacement died in a few weeks.	0
956	This is an excellent film.  	1
957	Battery life is real good.	1
958	I'm super pissd.	0
959	When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	0
960	This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	1
961	Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  	1
962	Of course, the acting is blah.  	0
963	The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.	0
964	That company is a joke.	0
965	The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  	1
966	The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  	1
967	These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.	1
968	Works well.	1
969	Do not make the same mistake as me.	0
970	Nice headset priced right.	1
971	It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  	0
972	Please dont waste your money.	0
973	Unfortunately it did not work.	0
974	I am glad I purchased it.	1
975	But this movie really got to me.  	1
976	We loved the place.	1
977	Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  	1
978	Do not waste your time.  	0
979	There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  	0
980	The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	1
981	I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0
982	If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
983	And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  	0
984	It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  	0
985	Its a total package.	1
986	his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
987	They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.	1
988	Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	1
989	It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  	1
990	The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
991	This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.	1
992	Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  	0
993	It was delicious!!!	1
994	Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  	1

997	I great reception all the time.	1
998	I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	0
999	It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
1000	Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0
1001	very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.	1
1002	The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	1
1003	a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	0
1004	This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  	0
1005	Great for the jawbone.	1
1006	This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.	0
1007	Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1
1008	It's very slow.  	0
1009	Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  	1
1010	The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
1011	walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
1012	It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.	1
1013	The music in the film is really nice too.  	1
1014	Lame would be the best way to describe it.  	0

1022	I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.	0
1023	In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  	0
1024	Battery life is also great!	1
1025	This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.	1
1026	i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.	1
1027	And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0
1028	Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  	0
1029	Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	1
1030	I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0
1031	This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.	0
1032	Superb Phone on a Great Network.	1
1033	You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.	0
1034	Waitress was a little slow in service.	0
1035	Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  	1
1036	it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.	0
1037	This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	1
1038	Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  	1
1039	This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	1
1040	But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
1041	An absolute must visit!	1
1042	Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.	1
1043	I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  	1
1044	In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  	0
1045	In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  	1
1046	The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  	0
1047	It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.	0
1048	Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.	1
1049	I really enjoyed eating here.	1
1050	The nachos are a MUST HAVE!	1
1051	Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	1

1053	But I thought his acting was skilled.  	1
1054	Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!	0

1062	"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as ""pretentious crap"".  "	0

1064	They have a really nice atmosphere.	1
1065	In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.	0
1066	It is an insane game.  	1
1067	The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	1
1068	I literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
1069	I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  	1
1070	Check it out.	1
1071	First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	0
1072	We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
1073	I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	1
1074	I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!	1
1075	Definitely a bargain.	1
1076	Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.	0
1077	Exceptionally bad!  	0
1078	This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  	1
1079	My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.	0
1080	Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0
1081	The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
1082	Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  	1
1083	The story is beyond stupid.  	0
1084	So absolutley fantastic.	1

1094	The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  	0
1095	RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	0

1101	Good case!.	1

1109	This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.	1
1110	It was horrendous.  	0
1111	It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  	1
1112	I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.	1
1113	It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.	1
1114	The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  	0

1121	What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  	0
1122	I waited and waited.	0
1123	Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.	0
1124	As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  	1
1125	Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  	1
1126	Not as good as I had hoped.	0
1127	We will not be coming back.	0
1128	Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	0
1129	Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
1130	Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0
1131	Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
1132	Very little music or anything to speak of.  	0
1133	I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did.	1
1134	One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	1
1135	He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	1
1136	I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0

1144	Overall, a delight!  	1
1145	They were golden-crispy and delicious.	1
1146	The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
1147	Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  	1
1148	Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.	0
1149	Overpriced for what you are getting.	0
1150	I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.	0
1151	Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	0
1152	Item Does Not Match Picture.	0
1153	This movie is also revealing.  	1
1154	I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  	0
1155	I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  	1
1156	Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  	1
1157	Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.	1
1158	I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.	1
1159	good item, low price.	1
1160	After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0
1161	The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.	1
1162	Now I know that I made a wise decision.	1
1163	For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	0
1164	The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	0
1165	Works great.	1
1166	You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  	0
1167	The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
1168	[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!	0
1169	The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).	1
1170	WORST PHONE EVER.	0
1171	However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.	0
1172	The directing seems too pretentious.  	0
1173	Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	1
1174	While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.	0
1175	I am also very happy with the price.	1
1176	But now I was completely grossed out.	0
1177	It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.	0
1178	How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  	0
1179	Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.	0
1180	The Burrittos Blah!	0
1181	10 out of 10 stars.  	1
1182	They work about 2 weeks then break.	0
1183	None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.	0
1184	When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.	0
1185	Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.	0
1186	I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  	0
1187	It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk.	0
1188	All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	1
1189	This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  	1
1190	I dont think I will be back for a very long time.	0
1191	The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
1192	The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.	0
1193	Barney is definitely super DE duper.  	1
1194	If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  	1
1195	Today the graphics are crap.  	0
1196	It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.	1
1197	Hell no will I go back	0
1198	Nice docking station for home or work.	1
1199	Design Flaw?.	0
1200	I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  	1

1202	Same problem as others have mentioned.	0

1206	The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.	1
1207	Great Phone.	1
1208	Very wind-resistant.	1
1209	This one just fails to create any real suspense.  	0
1210	Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!	1
1211	The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  	1
1212	Lots of holes in the script.  	0
1213	This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  	1
1214	Great phone.	1
1215	This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
1216	But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	0
1217	It even has its sweet moments.  	1
1218	Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.	0
1219	Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.	0
1220	This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	0
1221	By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!	1
1222	For the price this was a great deal.	1
1223	I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  	0
1224	I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  	0
1225	I'm a bit disappointed.	0
1226	Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  	0
1227	Once your food arrives it's meh.	0
1228	Spend your money and time some place else.	0
1229	I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
1230	Reasonably priced also!	1
1231	Sauce was tasteless.	0
1232	Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  	1
1233	I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  	1
1234	I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	1
1235	Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0
1236	A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  	1
1237	It's worth driving up from Tucson!	1
1238	I would recommend this.	1
1239	The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  	1
1240	Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0
1241	No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	0
1242	Awsome Device Works Great!!.	1
1243	Thank you for wasting my money.	0
1244	but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  	0
1245	The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
1246	At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0
1247	I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably.	1
1248	I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  	1
1249	I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	1
1250	This case seems well made.	1
1251	I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  	1
1252	A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.	1
1253	The service was poor and thats being nice.	0
1254	The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!	1
1255	I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  	1
1256	Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	1
1257	Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	1
1258	If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  	0
1259	It's a great item.	1
1260	"If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of ""The Way You Look Tonight""), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  "	1
1261	The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  	1
1262	Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  	0
1263	That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).	0
1264	You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  	0
1265	Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  	1
1266	The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.	1
1267	Great Product.	1
1268	I wear it everyday and it holds up very well.	1
1269	I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  	1
1270	It's A PIECE OF CRAP!	0
1271	This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1
1272	High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.	1
1273	cool phone.	1
1274	She carries the movie well.  	1
1275	Long, whiny and pointless.  	0
1276	The buttons for on and off are bad.	0
1277	The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0
1278	Food arrived quickly!	1
1279	Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.	0
1280	Great brunch spot.	1
1281	Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!	0
1282	It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
1283	Great phone!.	1
1284	Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  	1
1285	Never had anything to complain about here.	1
1286	It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.	1
1287	It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  	0
1288	The battery runs down quickly.	0
1289	You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  	1
1290	We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	0
1291	The only downside is the service.	0
1292	The mic is great.	1
1293	Also makes it easier to hold on to.	1
1294	Don't bother coming here.	0
1295	Used and dirty.	0
1296	I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0
1297	Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.	1
1298	While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  	1
1299	Penne vodka excellent!	1
1300	The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.	0
1301	Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.	1
1302	"The scenes with the ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  "	0
1303	The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  	0
1304	Overall, I like this place a lot.	1
1305	A bit predictable.  	0
1306	The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  	1
1307	About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  	0
