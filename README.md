# Analyzing Product Review System 
Analyzing product revuew system with BERT

## Outline
Last october 2018, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) achieved State of the art in the NLP (Natural
Language Processing) field. I used this and progressed Sentiment Analysis task. Through this, I would like to create a product
review analysis software that can be useful to companies.

## Research Goal
Sentiment Analysis using the existing BERT model, based on the result, it will check ther TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document
Frequency) similarity between the reviews. The program displays the reviews that BERT is harsh criticism and outputs other reviews with similarities to the reviews on the screen through user input.
