0	The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.	0
1	I bought it to go with my security camera system, but it did not perform like I thought it would. It doesn't alert us when someone is at the door. Also, I can't talk to the person at the door through the echo show, only through my cell phone.	1
2	I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
3	And then tragedy struck.	0
4	Worth every penny.	1
5	Big step up from the Dot! Dropped one star due to consistent delay in bringing up Ring Pro video, though looks great once the feed is displayed.	1
6	Bought this for our son as his birthday present and he loves it.  Often find him jamming to music in his room now  :)  He loves the options for the alarms and we have his weekday alarms set to repeat and he gets to sleep in on non-school days.	1
7	Been debating on getting one, but am happy I did! Still more to explore. Thanks!	1
8	Used and dirty.	0
9	All of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with Sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account. Asking any echo device to play music on Sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly. This went on for two weeks until I eventually solved the problem that neither Amazon nor Sonos could figure out.	0
10	However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  	0
11	daughter wanted a white boombox, nothing good out for 11 yr old.  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white BT good speaker.  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet.	1
12	This was a replacement. It was really easy to set up. I had to reauthorize my smart items to work with the new hub, but installation was easy and instructions were clear.	1
13	There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1
14	Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.	1
15	Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!	1
16	I haven't had my show very long or used it a lot, but I love it! I use it to set timers when cooking because my stove is being finicky and not wanting to work most of the time. I also use it to check for different recipes, listen to music and my all time favorite.... telling everyone it is time for dinner. My son gets a real kick out of that!I know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment, but remember the original echo didn't have what it has now when it first came out. I see that Amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon I am sure it will have all that we want very soon.... maybe even things we haven't thought of!I do wish it was a bit more user friendly. I still haven't figured out how to video chat with my cousin in North Carolina who also has one, and when I tried to call my son's dot it went to video chat immediately, last I looked, dots don't have video screens!Another thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep, it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill I had enabled that was free. So now he is a bit worried to use it again. That needs to be fixed.I do have to say that all in all I am very happy with my Echo Show!	1
17	Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.	1
18	Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.	1
19	He deserves 5 stars.	1
20	I'm trying to return it for a refund.	0
21	Not even good for camp value!  	0
22	!I definitly recommend!!	1
23	Again, lame.  	0
24	Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  	1
25	It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  	1
26	It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  	1
27	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐	1
28	I like that it responds every time. It was easy to set up.  I'm still learning what I can do with it. I may like a better speaker more.	1
29	What happened next was pretty....off putting.	0
30	The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  	1
31	In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  	0
32	Buy a different phone - but not this.	0
33	The sound on these is terrible. It’s like a tin can. I love my echo but this item is awful.	0
34	When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  	1
35	I literally vomited while watching this film.  	0
36	We love using it for bedtime reading on Audible. It's very kid-friendly, and I can see liking it in the kitchen while I'm cooking since it's small and unobtrusive. We like it better than our Echo Dot.	1
37	Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
38	I love my little Echo Spot, I have replaced my older full size echo with this little guy. The round screen is an interesting choice and I'm not sure I like the look but it is growing on me. The speakers could be slightly louder but all in all it is a solid echo product.	1
39	I love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too!! Great for family game nights	1
40	So far so good. Just got it and I am trying to figure out all the things it can do. The product itself is very well made.. And easy to set up.	1
41	I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!	1
42	My daughter has an Echo Show and she told me how much she loved it. I bought a white one for my kitchen and absolutely love it!  It has all the features of the others plus great extras. The sound system is awesome. I also own the original Echo Tower, Dots and Spot. Each are great and have their uses around my house. I highly recommend all of these products.	1
43	very nice! everything is working fine. just have to 100% learn the commands	1
44	I love it	1
45	His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  	1
46	Brilliance indeed.  	1
47	I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
48	lightweight and works well.	1
49	This is the 3rd unit I purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus. The only reason I purchased this is because it works so well and I wanted it in other rooms as well. All my switches work great and I have had not issues. I the past, I did have some ghost commands when Alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but I think some recent ipdates May have resolved this. It just keeps improving over time, not with call capabilities. I work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest, best way so far. Can’t wait to see what they come up with next.	1
50	This PDA rocks.	1
51	Smaller than I thought it would be. Happy I got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table.	1
52	I bought it for my sister and she hasn't had any complaints yet so I think it's great!	1
53	Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0
54	I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.	1
55	Easy to use!	1
56	Very satisifed with that.	1
57	Very excited to see what it can do	1
58	I used to use my laptop for anything show watching, including Netflix, but I am glad I bought this. This is super easy to set up and has everything you need with quick and easy access. Definitely worth the buy.	1
59	Love my echo. Love playing music in my room	1
60	This is actually a very smart movie.  	1
61	I live alone, this is the best companion!	1
62	Great easy to set up.A little difficult to navigate and the instructions are non existent	1
63	I had an Alexia built into my thermostat that just didn't work very well. I had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it. I decided to try the Echo Dot since it was on Prime Day. I have not been disappointed! It hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem. I really like that I can Bluetooth connect to my Bose Speaker for quality sound.	1
64	I would not recommend this place.	0
65	As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	1
66	This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is.	1
67	It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
68	I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times	1
69	Not substitute for the original.  The echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor.  To listen it has to be at the highest level 10.	1
70	There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.	0
71	Great for iPODs too.	1
72	Fantastic product, absolutely love it!	1
73	This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.	1
74	Being able to use it with my Alexa Echo was great!	1
75	We talk to her all the time for songs and just because we can . There aren’t dislikes about this device.	1
76	Needs to be smarter	1
77	The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1
78	Nope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm.. I dont know that.	0
79	I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.	0
80	Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.	1
81	My three year old loves it.  Good for doing basic household tasks.  We're going to add a few smart outlets and bulbs.	1
82	This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.	1
83	Extremely Tasty!	1
84	Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.	0
85	clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.	1
86	Best price we could find and it is so useful to have her around to answer questions. It is so handy to not have to find your phone. I also now have an intercom system.	1
87	it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself	1
88	Good product.	1
89	The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0
90	When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  	0
91	"""The descriptions said """"yum yum sauce"""" and another said """"eel sauce"""", yet another said """"spicy mayo""""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."""	0
92	Great product!	1
93	Garbage...Even trying to watch Amazon Prime Video this piece of garbage looses internet connection half way thru a show. The cheapest Roku works 100 time better. DO not waste your time or money on this piece of garbage.	0
94	Great ! It was the best decision ! Especially if you have Amazon Prime.	1
95	this is so fun! I really enjoy using it. I have it hooked up to one of my lights so I just tell Alexa when I want that on and off. also, it connects to my Spotify so I just have Alexa resume my playlist and we pick off right where we ended. I feel like there's even more I can do with this, so I'm excited to use it more!	1
96	very slow at seating even with reservation.	0
97	What a blast!  We love Echo...  Just learning all the tricks but lots of fun and helpful too!	1
98	As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!	0
99	The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  	1
100	"""I loved how easy this was to install sry up, and use! Simply amazing.  So amazing we bought two!This allowed us to officially """"CUT THE CABLE CORD"""".Love it!"""	1
101	more compact and a bit better than the original	1
102	I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	0
103	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_18	1
104	Very easy to install.  Very intuitive to use.  Very happy with the purchase.	1
105	We love it! Bought the light bulbs as well and we use it daily!	1
106	About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  	0
107	The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	0
108	I love that I can shut the microphone off at night so my children can’t talk to it at bed time and she has an automatic sleep timer for their lullaby music. Not sure how I survived with out this for so long.	1
109	Would not reccommend.	0
110	fast service.	1
111	These were so good we ordered them twice.	1
112	I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	1
113	(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  	1
114	This is my second Echo and I love how it helps me in the kitchen. I can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music.	1
115	Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0
116	Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.	1
117	Absolutely love it..  only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable.  When playing  music with  Bluetooth speaker outside I have to go inside to change songs.	1
118	I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  	0
119	This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.	1
120	The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
121	Protects the phone on all sides.	1
122	I bought this for my mother and she is in love with it.She loves the guard dog feature.She says that it gives her a sense of security at night and when she leaves the house	1
123	The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.	1
124	It offers hours of entertainment and it was very easy to install and activate 👍	1
125	I enjoy this thing. Its learning	1
126	Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  	1
127	I would love this remote if i wasnt spending so much money replacing the batteries. Its upsetting that i spent money on such a great device all for the batteries not to last.	0
128	Good Value	1
129	If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!	0
130	The reception is excellent!	1
131	Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	1
132	It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.	1
133	I love it now able to talk to my grandson with ease and the picture quality is great	1
134	I’m really hoping for skills that take advantage of the shows touch screen. There’s an incredible amount of untapped potential locked behind the restrictions. Make use of the best part of having the show and enable skills to navigate by touch please!	1
135	This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	1
136	We are sending it back.	0
137	Love it.	1
138	Like it to do more	1
139	We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
140	Easy to setup.  Sometimes Alexis does not work the greatest. The connection fire stick and WiFi is way bettter than Netflix .	1
141	The sound is wonderful and it just plain works. I wish it cost less, but it is worth the cost. (especially on Prime Day)	1
142	The thing I like most about my Echo Spot is the voice command feature.  You can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the Echo. Easy to use	1
143	Love it! Easy setup and I can ‘Drop in’ on my daughter and son-in-law who live in St. Louis anytime. Everyone loves to have their mother drop in, right 😎	1
144	I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.	1
145	Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  	1
146	I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.	1
147	I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.	1
148	That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	1
149	Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn’t be happier!	1
150	bought two of these. One for my kitchen and the other for my sewing room. Its great if I need a recipe or need to know how to do something.  I am still learning everything it can do.	1
151	The service was poor and thats being nice.	0
152	This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  	1
153	Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa	1
154	definitely will come back here again.	1
155	Absolutely great.	1
156	What we liked most was actually seeing the words to song. Least would be I guess I expected a little more from her than is currently available.	1
157	It works great. Better than the previous fire stick!	1
158	I purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because I found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking, cutting, cleaning, etc. especially when our counters aren’t very wide to begin with. After going back and forth between this and the show I decided on this because I felt it had all the same features but is more compact. I can honestly say I have no regrets. While I probably wouldn’t watch a movie I’d been dying to see on this, it’s a great way to listen to music, watch a quick YouTube video, etc. I even attempted watching “Jaws” on this and while it wasn’t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn’t as bad as one would think. I would definitely recommend!	1
159	Love it.. Great armband.	1
160	The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  	1
161	"""I purchased the """"Show """" to keep in touch with my daughter and her family after their recent move half way across the country.  It is wonderful seeing their faces during our conversations."""	1
162	Sounds great!! Love them!	1
163	I love it	1
164	Good sound! The capacity of join different apps to make work your smart home	1
165	Listening to music, searching locations, checking time, looking up weather. There are many more task to learn. It was simple to set up.	1
166	I’m still learning how to use the Echo, but so far I love it!	1
167	I love it!!!!!!	1
168	neat tool we enjoy it with the family	1
169	I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	0
170	A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.	0
171	Eh. It’s works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine	0
172	The only draw back is it stops every once in awhile in the middle of a song .	1
173	"""The """"1.2"""" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7."""	1
174	Can’t change voice of Echo	1
175	Amazing product. Still learnimg all the things it can do	1
176	This was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. He loves it, ask Alexa anything she has the answer, plus it’s good for homework. So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I’m getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it’s metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock..	1

178	I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	0
179	Great sound quality, works well with smart home devices	1
180	It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.	1
181	I was able to use this in another room and add Alexa in that room.	1
182	Nice, spicy and tender.	1
183	Totally believable.  	1
184	This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.	0
185	Everything about this product is wrong.First	0
186	This was purchased for our toy hauler, but it came the day before we left for a trip by plane.  It was wonderful to plug into our hotel TV and watch our normal tv shows rather than whatever was showing at the time and sit through commercials.	1
187	I love this device. I upgraded from the Echo Spot. I just wish I could customize the clock on my screen to analog, to mimic what I was used to in the echo spot. Also, there is better sound quality on this device.	1
188	Love the echo dot	1
189	Love to have meditation music, I use it as a morning alarm, just to mention few in general I love it	1
190	Good as new! Perfectly packaged and I have had zero issues with the dot.	1
191	Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  	0
192	I love my Echo Dot!  The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money.	1
193	I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  	0
194	We like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly.  You can even hear music played. The speaker is clear.  We are enjoying it.  What we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me.  The next day, I asked the Echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song.  The Echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before.  It was a little disconcerting.	1
195	It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.	0
196	I bought this after visiting a friend who had one and it is great.  I understand the frustration of not having YouTube though.  Still good to have-love seeing the words to songs and if you have the Ring doorbell-you never have to get up from your chair...laziness at it's best!  LOL  All in all- a great product with good speakers.	1
197	I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them	1
198	Works great and it's so easy to use that my 4 year old can navigate it.	1
199	It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0
200	All in all, a great disappointment.  	0
201	My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without.	1
202	Works fine, I just realize I don’t need this because I don’t use it.	0
203	Works great with my existing smart home setup.	1
204	:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.	1
205	Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  	0
206	All things considered, a job very well done.  	1
207	I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
208	Love this!	1
209	So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.	1
210	I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!	1
211	Works great!	1
212	It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  	1
213	The echo doesn’t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient.	1
214	I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven't decided if I'll keep it or not!	1
215	Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!	1
216	I am glad I purchased it.	1
217	I enjoy it. Still discovering new uses.	1
218	Exceeded my expectations	1
219	Device is touted as able to link to calendar on my Samsung phone through google, can't get it to work	1
220	Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool.	1
221	We are using the internet for our home and loving them	1
222	I like the built in hub. Plus the unit sounds great, just wish it had a volume control on it.	1
223	I wouldn't recommend buying this product.	0
224	AMAZING. It has helped me become better organized, gives me traffic updates, weather updates, and helps me maintain a good, fast morning routine.	1
225	I use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker. It works great for what I need.	1
226	The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
227	Easy to set up, can control Kasa smart plugs no problem.  Even the kids have figured stuff out that I would not have asked Alexa, like telling jokes and singing. The Alexa app controls my custom spark plug and my cloud cam.	1
228	Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!	1
229	It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  	1
230	Very easy to use.	1
231	Sound quality is less than a dot, microphones don't pick me up as well as the other models (i have Echo and Dots).  Picture quality is good	1
232	I promise they won't disappoint.	1
233	We are very pleased with this item. The display is clean and crisp and easy to read. We enjoy trying the suggested things to try asking Alexa. We use the timer feature quite a bit and have added our calendars and contacts. We are still exploring the many skills available.	1
234	every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it.	1
235	I having it in my living room. Music sounds really good in my living room . I can hear it upstairs.	1
236	The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.	1
237	Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.	1
238	I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I’d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I’ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights.	0
239	Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.	1
240	Love it!	1
241	It won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won’t work	1
242	Works wonderfully.	1
243	I was very impressed with the price of the cases.	1
244	I purchased this for my daughter and we all love this!!!! its amazing!! we love the games!	1
245	There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  	1
246	Used to have fun with. Great to play music, turn on lights and who know what else.	1
247	Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.	0
248	The Firestick we were sent doesn’t work. At all.  Voice remote won’t even turn on. We did all the troubleshooting steps. Didn’t work. Contacted Amazon. They sent us a new one - with no remote/no way to control it! We gave up and got a Roku (which works great!)	0
249	Cool	1
250	Works great. Easy set up.	1
251	Nice case, feels good in your hands.	1
252	I live this item.  I bought several for each room in the house and as a gift for my Mom.  I also use mine to travel with.	1
253	Being able to tell it what to go to	1
254	Lousy product.	0
255	We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	0
256	This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc.	1
257	The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  	0
258	I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.	0
259	IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  	0
260	Excellent quality, very good sound, great deal on Prime Day.	1
261	I have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. It was even easier to set up than my original echo.	1
262	Love it!!! Convenient. Responsive. Learns voices within the household. Best assistant so far!	1
263	You can't access YouTube! Why do consumer's have to pay for this argument! Why can't we just have a good product that offers what we need?	1
264	If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.	1
265	Great phone!.	1
266	Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo.	1
267	Never could get it to work. A techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter wasn't strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store. So, I am going to replace the adapter and hope it works then.	0
268	This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
269	It has great sound and very responsive to commands!	1
270	Very.god	1
271	Just don't know why they were so slow.	0
272	It does everything  the big guy does	1
273	The echo dot disconnects from the speaker about 12-20 times a day. Do not buy the refurbished product.  2 stars for effort.	0
274	I did not expect this to be so good!	1
275	* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!	1
276	This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!	0
277	very disappointed.	0
278	WORKS GREAT	1
279	The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!	0
280	An excellent performance from Ms.  	1
281	I love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered another.	1
282	This is my second Echo and I love how it helps me in the kitchen. I can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music.	1
283	Works great... bought it for my shop so that it is like an intercom to the house.	1
284	The food came out at a good pace.	1
285	Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.	1
286	I love it the coolest thing since sliced bread	1
287	I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product.	1
288	The first one quit working shortly after I got it. The next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app. I am not sure if it just this Dot or they are all this way.	0
289	The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.	1
290	The Echo Show is ok, however the constant suggestions about what to ask Alexa are sooooo annoying and there is no way to eliminate it. Also, I thought I could have the weather for an area displayed continuously,  but I have to talk to Alexa, which I don't want to do in the middle of the night. Had I payed full price it would have been returned. There are other features that are nice, but I may never use them.	1
291	It f****** sucks	0
292	Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?	0
293	I'm amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.	1
294	Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  	0
295	Granddaughter loves it	1
296	I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.	0
297	I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.	1
298	I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly.	1
299	Conclusion - I loved it.  	1
300	Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,información de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet.	1
301	much better than the hard plastic cases.	1
302	Great food and awesome service!	1
303	CAN WATCH AMAZON PRIME SHOWS AND TALK TO ALEXUS	1
304	This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!	1
305	Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.	1
306	Love all of it!!!	1
307	wont work right or atleast for me.	0
308	The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	1
309	Linked to my phone without effort.	1
310	The volume is very low	0
311	Love my Amazon products	1
312	The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.	0
313	The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  	0
314	As for the service, I thought it was good.	1
315	I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.	0
316	An absolute must visit!	1
317	Phone falls out easily.	0
318	Still learning to use these things.  They sure are smart!  haha  She started reading a book to me yesterday.  Get one.  I like the way it controls the brightness all by itself when lights are turned off at night.	1
319	very easy to set up and very easy to use	1
320	"""Some applause should be given to the """"prelude"""" however.  """	1
321	Great Earpiece.	1
322	Purchased as a gift,	1
323	this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1
324	Absolutel junk.	0
325	Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  	0
326	Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all, this is a fabulous speaker.	1
327	Love it getting use to it and Alexa is getting use to my voice . Sometimes she doesn't answer but I think it has to do when internet is low or is updating or my voice isn't strong. Over all I haven't had any of the annoying stuff that everyone is complaining about. Thank goodness I didn't listen to those reviews.  And paid attention to the Apple guy .	1
328	Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.	1
329	Very good quality and you don’t have to yell or be close for it to work and understand you properly	1
330	Excellent product for the price.	1
331	I think I now have 5 of these throughout the house. So convenient to set a timer or check the weather or whatever, wherever.	1
332	I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	0
333	I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.	1
334	awesome product! I am in the process of having every room in my house set up with automation and The Show is now my favorite device!	1
335	Easy to use. Great for recipes, listen to music, see movies, movie trailers, so much to do....	1
336	I would not recommend this item to anyone.	0
337	WooHoo! $20 on Prime Day; done!	1
338	The cast is good.  	1
339	its okay but keeps dropping wifi!	1
340	It was easy to use for our bedroom TV.	1
341	Great	1
342	Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.	0
343	Great product	1
344	This is an excellent film.  	1
345	Good price. Prompt shipping. Has been working flawlessly.	1
346	You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  	0
347	The speakers arent too loud.. alexa is great though. Besides that naw	1
348	God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  	0
349	New to Alexa. Like this spot a lot.	1
350	I like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn't sometimes I have to reset it I don't know if it's because it's refurbished but it's okay it's just not what I expected	1
351	Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.	0
352	At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0
353	Good wifi TV stick	1
354	If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  	1
355	Love, Love, Love my Amazon Echo Plus!!❤️❤️	1
356	If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.	0
357	Love it!	1
358	I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great.	1
359	The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
360	The sound of the speaker is better than the other Echo I own!	1
361	I AM COMPLETELY IN LOVE. DOES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING AND IS SO AMAZING AND GREAT	1
362	The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
363	This is a great deal.	1
364	Avoid this film at all costs.  	0
365	Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.	1
366	I already had purchased the Echo and a couple of Dots and hesitated to purchase this until the price dropped.  I am very glad I did.  The versatility of the video screen is outstanding.  No regrets!	1
367	Not impressed	1
368	Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	0
369	I am a hardcore fan of Echo. Infact I am in love with all members of my Alexa family. I have Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and now this new toddler Echo Spot. Every variant has its own beauty. I love feel and size of Echo Spot. It’s fabulous as far as looks are concerned. It does not have great Audio quality (which I did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size). I bought it to connect with my Bose SoundTouch.	1
370	There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  	1
371	I purchased this refurbished.  Works just like brand new.  3 minute set up. Very easy.  Now I have echo dot that I can command to start playing music for my backyard deck sound system.	1
372	I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  	1
373	I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!	0
374	Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound	1
375	Great price, works perfectly. Saved the money on a refurb!! Would buy again!	1
376	Not impressed.	0
377	Works as advertised. Very easy to setup. Still learning what this can do.	1
378	if you don't have an Echo you definitely need one	1
379	It's a great item.	1
380	Small device that my kids like to ask questions. Very handy friendly interactive	1
381	Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
382	It works just like my other Dots.	1
383	Very poor service.	0
384	Love the Spot - Awesome little guy with precise video - I’m saving to buy one for my mom on the east coast - The Spot changes Everything as far as keeping your loved ones connected!!!Well worth every Cent!!	1
385	need a few more	1
386	Love these guys they work so great	1
387	It talks to me, plays the type of music i want to listen to, and even turns off when I ask if to.	1
388	Was not happy.	0
389	Does Not Work.	0
390	Was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all	1
391	It’s easier to do things with it	1
392	This phone works great.	1
393	It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	0
394	poor voice clarity.	0
395	It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  	1
396	It works great, but the reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time. Pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available.	1
397	The film looks cheap and bland.  	0
398	I was skeptical at first but &#34;it&#34; grows on you.  It looks good, so far.  I did, however, turn off the camera.	1
399	This is an awesome product. I wanted to test out the differences between this and my Roku and both are very nice. I will likely be using this for traveling as well.	1
400	Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more	1
401	Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.	0
402	The simplicity of use and setting up.	1
403	its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.	1
404	The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	0
405	Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  	1
406	I am in love with alexa	1
407	Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.	1
408	I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.	1
409	I am more than happy with this product.	1
410	Third echo dot purchased. Love the product.	1
411	Love this thing works great and kids love it to	1
412	Works absolutely great	1
413	It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  	0
414	Must have been an off night at this place.	0
415	This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  	0
416	BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
417	Excellent bluetooth headset.	1
418	Great Purchase	1
419	Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
420	Works awesome!	1
421	Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.	1
422	I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.	0
423	The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.	0
424	ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO EASY TO USE BETTER THAN SCROLLING CHANNELS.	1
425	Disappointing experience.	0
426	I dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.	1
427	I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.	1
428	Great	1
429	This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.	0
430	Very fun to use and having morning briefing	1
431	Have not used it yet. But I'm sure it's as great as the others.. I can not get over how amazing the echo , echo dots are. This has to be some of the greatest technology that has ever came out.	1
432	Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  	1
433	I like the option for white, but it’s bizarre that it comes with a black cord. I have a white kitchen, so now I have this stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb black power cord. For aesthetic purposes, I was happier with my year-old white Echo (not Show) because it came with a white powercord. This seems like a major design flaw in the “white” option. I strongly urge Amazon to change out the powercord to white.	1
434	I had a pretty satifying experience.	1
435	Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.	0
436	I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  	0
437	Works amazing! I love how you can download almost anything. Some apps I couldn’t download on my Apple TV but I was able too on here!!!	1
438	Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
439	Beautiful styling though.	1
440	I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...	1
441	The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.	1
442	Awesome device wish I bought one ages ago.	1
443	I love you, Alexa!	1
444	So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
445	I love every aspect of the Echo Plus, I wanted it for my office. The light was also for my desk lamp.	1
446	works like any other one!	1
447	In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.	0
448	Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered.	1
449	Damn good steak.	1
450	I love my new Echo Dot! Right now, I mainly use it to play music at night, but it gets the job done.	1
451	Alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time	1
452	"""It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing """"Turkey in the Straw"""" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  """	1
453	Works as you’d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.	1
454	I love this thing!	1
455	A great device	1
456	LOVE IT!!!!!	1
457	In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
458	Love it	1
459	Great product, easy to install and use! Not a necessity but a commodity!	1
460	The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  	1
461	a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	0
462	Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.	1
463	Purchased as a more &#34;personal&#34; contact vehicle for engaging with long distance grandchildren. Works perfectly in every regard. Resolution and sound both better than expected. Highly recommend.	1
464	Product forces user to review Alexa Things to Try. There is no way to disable it.	0
465	Well I’m a big fan of echoes these ones went I’m my bathrooms.  Works just great as expected 👍🏾	1
466	I love everything about the fire stick. It’s easy to use and Alexa makes it quicker to get to tv shows or music.	1
467	I love it!!!	1
468	Will be back again!	1
469	Mic Doesn't work.	0
470	We are loving Ours very much	1
471	) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  	1
472	I love having this on my desk. The fact that I can video with friends, listen to music with the words right there, and see my Amazon Cloud Cam feeds from one location is pretty spectacular. I got this one sale too, which was stellar. It has me thinking I need another one for the front room.	1
473	This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  	0
474	Works great no different than the new ones	1
475	Now this dish was quite flavourful.	1
476	We love our echo spots. We now have three through the house and like that you can drop in on the other spots. We do wish the clock faces had more customization options and that there were more faces in general.	1
477	The voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :)	1
478	We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed.	1
479	I have a friend now.	1
480	I love these, I have 2 dots and one echo. For a medium size rooms these are loud enough without external speakers although I do use external for the dots.	1
481	The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.	0
482	Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.	1
483	Este producto llegó y a la semana se quedó sin olor, perdió toda su escencia, huele solo a alcohol	1
484	I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  	1
485	They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.	1
486	Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  	0
487	One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	1
488	Very easy set up. Really enjoying it	1
489	We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	1
490	Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.	0
491	While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.	0
492	Good product I like it . Thank you !	1
493	It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.	0
494	Love our echo! Thing the full size version sounds better though.	1
495	Works great.	1
496	Seems to work ok, but no youtube tv?  Really?  can't believe they would ban an app that so many people want to use.  I really wanted to like it, but when I couldn't install that particular app it became almost useless, almost.  Does most other stuff just fine, but I'll stick with my Roku.	0
497	Great Pocket PC / phone combination.	1
498	I love this fire stick because after installing a few highly recommended apps, I discovered that a lot of the channels I don't have with my cable provider is included,  and I don't have to pay extra! Just subscribing to a few streaming apps will do and I still come out paying way less than cable tv.	1
499	Overall good device. It was bought for a workout room, and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine. It could use a much better speaker.	1
500	I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.	0

510	I have not had it very long. It's my first Alexa thing. I sure like what I have done with it so far there is a lot to learn and play with	1
511	If you want a real scare rent this one!  	1
512	quite nice...clear, great sound.	1
513	So far so good	1
514	Got one for me and for my son on Prime Day. We love them! I want one in every room, but that would be excessive.	1
515	Use it all the time and love it. Very quality product.	1
516	Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0
517	Only complaint I have is that the sound quality isn't great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don't mind the audio quality, but if you're bothered by that kind of thing I'd go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers.	1
518	I have it in the kitchen. Great for news or music in the a.m. I can video call my daughter and grand kids. I really dig it!	1
519	Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0

522	What a waste of time!	0
523	Yet, I enjoy watching it.  	1
524	WORST PHONE EVER.	0
525	No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .	1
526	I would like to tell you that I have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck, or the color, or the shape or even the way it smells, but I can honestly say the number reason I hate this device is I have tried to set it up 3x's now to no avail, I have 4 other Echo devices already that I set up and use quite regularly, I have reset my phone (Galaxy S8), checked the app for updates, I have cycled power to the Echo unit with each attempt. I work in the network/technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now, so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here. I used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up, the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and I have to force the app to close, restart my phone and the Echo and try again. I figured 3x's was enough, it shouldn't be that hard a techie, I can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology....I hope they won't call me I'll tell em to send the product back!	0
527	The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.	1
528	Easy set up	1
529	I am happy with the refurbished echo dot. I’ve had it for about two weeks, and so far it is working perfectly! Even though it did not come in its original box, it looks like new! I’m happy with this purchase!	1
530	but it is great, i would really recommend it	1
531	For the price this was a great deal.	1
532	It was an excellent purchase. Echo Plus has sound quality, good size, I love it... I it!	1
533	Everything about it is just bad.  	0
534	Don't waste your $$$ on this one.	0
535	Great Value.	1
536	This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.	1
537	It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  	1
538	I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.	1
539	Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0

547	I like the fact that the messages are visual now as well as audible.I am puzzled because it will light up and make the &quot;notification&quot; sound but when I ask Alexa to read my notifications, she tells me that there are no new notifications.  This has happened at least once a day for over a week now.	1

561	We put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don't know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.	1
562	Amazingly fun. My daughter and I just asked questions on the first day. I have now set my daily alarm, weekend reminder, playlist, morning shows, random songs, daily bible verses, weather, and morning commute. It tells me which way to go dodging traffic. You have to get one. I don’t have it linked to my phone yet.	1
563	I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0

588	I am quite disappointed by this product.There clearly is a bug: half of the time I ask for a newsflash, two second after it starts, the whole thing stops and reboots for a couple of minutes. Same goes when I ask to play the radio. Also, many times it get confused when I ask to switch of &#34;the lights&#34;...as other items are also named the same, which is not true. Clearly no AI or natural language, very 'beta' stage still for me. Not impressed!	0
589	This is the one of my favorite Amazon devices.  Have one in my bedroom and use as alarm clock. Perfect addition to our home of Alexa devices.	1

600	I absolutely love this! Very user friendly and I got the Kasa Cam to go with it to monitor my living room. Super easy to set up and operate. I only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately. I’m looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces. I like digital but I miss the colon in between the hours and minutes on most of them. I’d also like to see more celebs jump on board for the alarm voices. I really have no complaints, I’m being nit picky at this point. Worth every penny!	1
601	Very pleased	1
602	Excellent product and service.  Very easy to install and my daughter is very happy.	1
603	Simply amazing what a awsome device. It never ceases to amaze me, wake up to big bang music, go to sleep softly falling rain. Drop in on the kids and keep in touch. I have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do.	1
604	A Disappointment.	0
605	Surprisingly handy. Wish it had more options geared towards it being on your nigh stand. Like an even dimmer setting.	1

625	Refurbished but just as good as the new ones that I've bought.	1
626	For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “Alexa”.	0

Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!	1

677	Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well.	1
678	I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.	1
679	Great device, features are awesome, the interaction is fantastic. Home automation works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly. My only issue is out of (4) Echo Shows (2) of them have been sent off for repair because of the screen glitching!! These are less than 3 months old and already having issues!First repairs were sent off and they “updated the firmware” when I got the device back nothing worked, I had to update to the newest firmware for it to work again. Then (2) weeks later the glitch starts up again!I love the show but I’m getting really frustrated with the glitching.	0

702	Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet.	1

726	The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.	1
727	I basically use it to play music  and tell me the news..its sometimes hard to communicate with it, if i dont say the command correctly, but i realize its learning my style of speaking and will do some commands even though i dont say them exactly as i should.	1
728	The sound is amazing and many collections of all music	1
729	But I definitely would not eat here again.	0
730	Very easy set up. Really enjoying it	1
731	Eh it’s cool and all but also kinda boring I don’t really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 3/5 is about right. I can’t connect to my Spotify unless it’s premium and I’m in college and I’m not paying or that or amazon music so	1
732	This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  	1
733	Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	1
734	very nice gadget. love it's look.	1
735	AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.	0
736	Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.	0
737	I LOVE my Firestick.	1
738	Works great and simple to set up. Alexa is way more accurate than I imagined so Im using it more than I thought. Wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.No she's not listening when you don't say the wake word so if you're worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. The speaker is great too so don't hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.	1
739	seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	0

744	I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!	1
745	Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.	1
746	Expensive but it is a slightly better sound than my Original Echo.	1
747	I would recommend saving room for this!	1
748	Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.	1
749	This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  	1
750	The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0
751	I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	1
752	This is my first smart device and I will surely be buying other devices that will be compatible with this one.	1
753	ok	1

756	Love it!	1
757	The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.	1
758	I use the product as an alarm clock. I love being able to set my schedule for the week and not worry about it. When images are shown, they are cut off. Little because its trying to fit it into a circle.	1
759	Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!	1
760	It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  	1
761	All of the main players are mesmerising.  	1
762	Just like the other one	1
763	It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  	0
764	I purchased the Echo Plus with the Build-in Hub, so I could have the convenience of asking Alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off.  Philips Hue Light Bulbs were placed in the fixtures that I wanted Alexa to control and they all work great!  I already had an Echo Dot in my Kitchen/Den area, so I placed the Echo Plus with Hub in my bedroom. My radio and lamps in my Kitchen and Den are controlled with TP-Link plugs.  But, the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my Den and Bedroom have special Philips Hue Light Bulbs that are controlled by the Hub inside the Echo Plus.  I am able to play music, set my alarm, get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices.  The Echo Dot requires a TP-Link plug to be plugged into it and the Echo Plus requires a special Philips Light Bulbs installed in each light fixture to work..  The only thing I dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work. Regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with Alexa and  the Echo Plus with Hub.  Other than the high price of the bulbs, I love my Echo Plus with built in hub!	1
765	Works like a new one.  Can tell the difference from the new one I bough and the refurbished one.	1
766	Everything about it is great, love the Alexa voice remote	1
767	Use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home	1
768	I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.	1
769	I really like the echo dot. It’s amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.	1
770	Not good enough for the price.	0
771	I love being able to control lights, doors and music.	1
772	Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!	1
773	This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	0
774	It was so funny.  	1
775	I use this product for enjoyment and I just love it	1
776	Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	0
777	The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	0
778	Nice Sound.	1
779	Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.	1
780	I dislike that it confuses my requests all the time.	1
781	cool phone.	1
782	Great product at a great price.	1
783	Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.	0
784	But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  	1
785	So far I’m very pleased with my Echo Show.  The problem is, there’s so much it can do that I haven’t been able to explore the extent of its abilities! I got the special price as part of the Prime Day promotion...and you just can’t beat what you get for the price.  Very pleased with the sound. The video screen is sharp. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get Alexa to perform a command...but as I get to know the system better, I’m hoping that will improve.  One drawback in the music...I’ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  Example: Secret Agent Man by Johnny Rivers...a “live”version is used, not the original version.  If I’m going to pay for Prime Music...I’d like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  Or at least give me a choice of what I want to hear.  Otherwise, I am very pleased with my Echo Show.  So pleased in fact, that I bought a second one!	1
786	I wanted a white dot for my white bathroom.  The top is black as shown, which I knew, but I did not realize the cord and plug were also black. I wanted a white cord and plug.	0
787	Predictable, but not a bad watch.  	1
788	I didn’t realize it needed an external power source in order to utilize the fire stick. I thought it was more along the lines of a flash drive device you Singley plugged into your tv. However, since using my amazon fire stick I have enjoyed every moment of it and would definitely recommend this product to any and all.	1
789	When we first received this product, it was great.  However, about a week ago, the device served up a video advertisement around 10:30pm at night and scared myself and my family.  If you want to make sure you are protected and don't allow video directly in your home, the spot is not a device that can keep you safe.	0
790	Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
791	So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	1

798	I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  	1
799	This makes a big difference in searching for programs, so much easier then the older fire stick, faster to.	1
800	Plus, it's only 8 bucks.	1
801	i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.	1
802	It’s great but sound quality is very low	1
803	I'll be returning it.  It's been nothing but annoying.  The hub can't be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my Hue Bridge.  I can't even install Philips lights with it unless I unplug it to do so.  There are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues.  Bottom line is it sucks as a hub.  It doesn't support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness I knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point?  I noticed right away that my Philips Hue Bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this doesn't.  I found that rather interesting.	0
804	Very easy to install and am excited to use!	1
805	We love our Echo Plus. We like listening to music,the sound is great. All the features are nice! I do wish it was wireless so we could listen to music outside!	1

840	Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.	1
841	Works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for Alexa doesn't work as well as the normal Echo.  Sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me when I try to interrupt her it to give new instructions.  The speaker also isn't as good as the normal Echo.  Screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who's at the front door.  But, it's great for the bedside.	1

849	&#34;NEVER BUY CERTIFIED AND REFURBISHED ECHO DOT &#34; I bought a &#34;Certified and Refurbished &#34; Echo Dot. This unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command. Never buy a refurbished Echo dot. The unit I received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated. I also bought a new ECHO dot, it works perfectly.Very disappointed !!!!	0
850	The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  	0

854	The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  	1
855	I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item.	1
856	I bought this specifically so my wife could look at our Arlo security cameras from the bedroom when I’m at work. The system worked for three days and now it just gives me a error message. Very disappointed due to the fact that they advertise that these systems work together. I gave four stars because it does everything else very well.	1
857	Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.	1
858	This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1
859	It is just not as loud as I thought it was going to be.	1
860	It seems easy to stump Alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer.  We admit that we have not explored all that's available through the Echo.  One irritating issue is that Alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system, rather it refers you to the Alexa app or help via a computer.  It was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful.	1
861	Waitress was good though!	1
862	Love this! Replaced an old alarm clock in my bedroom with this.  Love that it dims at night. Very responsive to commands.	1

868	I was really happy with my original echo so i thought I'd get an echo dot to use in my bedroom. I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.	0
869	I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.	1
870	Works well I have several of these recommend to anyone	1
871	You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  	1
872	Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  	1
873	Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  	0

905	If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE. I thought this was Amazon, not Apple??!! I’ve paid for many of these so I could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??	0
906	Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.	0

910	I got this for my husband on Prime Day. He loves it as his alarm clock and smart device. This is our 3rd Echo device, and we have them all connected throughout the house. Although you can deactivate the camera, we also chose to cover it since the device is in our bedroom. I'm not comfortable with having a camera in the room (no, we don't bring our cell phones in the room).	1
911	Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!	1
912	My rating: just 3 out of 10.  	0
913	I love being able to see information that Alexa gives.  When notifications are turned on it lets you know when your order will be delivered and it also tells you what the order is. You can use the Echo screen to pull up details of your orders. You can use the Alexa skill to make calls from uhyour Echo.	1
914	I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.	1
915	See it.  	1
916	Pros- plenty loud for a large room with high ceilings.Cons - the hub doesn’t do anything.  It doesn’t work with z wave (as it states), it doesn’t take voice commands for SmartThings, which I had to buy since the hub doesn’t work for z wave.It also sounds muffled and there is no way to control the EQ. (Not sure if that is on all models, but the Dots we have are clear.For the money, buy an echo dot or echo (2nd generation).  The echo dot takes voice commands for the smart things hub, go figure, and the audio is clear. The dot also seems to hear my voice better and almost at a whisper.	1
917	Love it!	1
918	Great size for bedside. Plus it dims at night!!	1
919	I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	1
920	The ear buds only play music in one ear.	0
921	Refurbish Echo Dot received as new condition, as new packaging, no complaints. Neat little gadget.(Drives my wife nuts!)	1
922	If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  	1
923	This thing is awesome for grocery lists, paired with the AnyList app. The flash briefing is very good too. My only complaint is that once you pause something, Alexa decides that you no longer want to listen to that thing. Forever. All in all, definitely worth the purchase.	1
924	This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  	1
925	Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
926	Love this product.	1
927	I do love these things, i have them running my entire home, TV, all my lights, my thermostat, my front door dead bolt, the cameras... and i love listening to npr. these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek.... I named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems.	1
928	Fun to work with still learning everything she can do	1
929	I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly.	1
930	They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  	1
931	Loved all about it, all I can do with it and it looks good.	1
932	I love my Echo Dot!  The price I paid during Prime Day was comparable to buying a new digital clock with the bells and whistles, but this does so much more.  I can play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on and on.  Definitely worth the money.	1
933	At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  	0
934	this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.	1
935	I love being able to have Alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up.	1

951	It's worth driving up from Tucson!	1
952	I decided to buy smart door lock and decided on getting the Echo Plus to control it.  I chose a Kwikset 888 because Amazon said it was compatible and I bought 2 Dots while I was at it.  And when I posed the question, somebody in the community said it will work with Alexa.  What I didn't know was the Z-wave lock and Zigbee Alexa hub weren't compatible.  Does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with Echo Plus?  If not, I guess my choices are: 1. Exchange the Plus for a regular Echo and buy a separate hub like Wink.  2. Return the whole Alexa system and get something else.I  don't want to just buy another hub to use along side my Echo Plus or I'll be back here asking how to integrate two hubs.The reason I kept from buying smart systems up to this point  is because I was afraid they wouldn't operate seamlessly and unfortunately I only do enough research after something doesn't work.	0
953	Alexa was able to call my phone when I couldn’t find it and also turned on and off the light when commanded.  Then I came home a day later and it wouldn’t turn on the light but would shut it off.  Then she said I had no devices; couldn’t find my phone.  Now working again.  We will see.  Love the selection of music!	1
954	The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  	1
955	Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  	1
956	The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
957	Alexa is pretty basic and almost like a toy. Shouldn't have been released into the market without proper development. Speech recognition fails to understand basic American and British Accent.The music it can play is very restrictive. Speech isn't refined in a way that we understand a (almost a) human is speaking. Linking to Youtube via amazon web services doesn't work.	1

963	It was a gift and the recipient love love loves it 😍💋💋💋💋❤!	1
964	They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	1
965	The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).	0
966	I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.	1
967	Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!	1
968	I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.	1
969	Great, love it!	1

971	We love the Show.  It loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an Show issue or our internet issue.  But overall we use it for many applications.	1
972	Absolutely LOVE my Echo Show!  It is awesome and works great with my Ring Video Spotlight Cams!  Music on demand and so many more features that I have yet to explore!!!	1
973	Everything	1
974	It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
975	Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	0
976	I was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.	1
977	Love my new Echo Plus	1
978	Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  	1
979	you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	1
980	I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title.	1
981	He was terrible!	0
982	Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  	1
983	Finally bought one but it couldn't find my Wi-Fi. Had to buy a Wi-Fi extended. My smart t.v. used the Wi-Fi just fine.	1
984	Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!	1
985	Love my Alexa! Actually have 3 throughout the house. Favorite function is lists. Great for time management and if course, music.	1
986	Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.	0

997	Its reception is very very poor.	0
998	I’m impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it’s definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can’t use my Apple Music account.	1
999	Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.	1
1000	Alexa is a decent speaker if that's all you need. She is terrible at most other things. She consistently answers questions that were not asked or says &#34;hmmm I don't know that&#34; for everything else. We've gone back to just using our phones because she can't really look anything up. Pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when I had an awesome Bose bluetooth already. I bought her because my mother (who lives alone) uses hers a lot and is happy with it, but we have a full house with kids and I'm less than impressed. I'd never recommend it to anyone except for senior citizens who love alone and need to be able to shout out for help in the event of a fall.	1
1001	I am really enjoying the many different features on my Alexa, especially listening to music and audio books	1
1002	This Echo Dot is horrible. The volume on my phone is louder than than this device. My boss has one at this is not the case	0
1003	Excellent dual-purpose headset.	1
1004	Highly recommended A+  	1
1005	Very satisfied with the purchase. The package came in good time and was just as expected	1
1006	The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	1
1007	There's room for improvement on this. For the price, I cannot complain too much. I can still complain however, the audio is terrible. This is kind of like listening to a speak-n-spell from the 80s.	1
1008	The accompanied software is almost brilliant.	1
1009	You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  	1

1014	A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	0
1015	The Echo Spot has really helped me to streamline my day and be more efficient! It reminds me of any appointments, warns me about traffic snarls, and tells me the weather every day while suggesting new music and introducing me to new artists.	1

1019	The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  	0
1020	Easy set up, works perfect.	1
1021	works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.	1
1022	I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.	0
1023	I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.	1
1024	It works OK. This speaker quality is not much better than my iPhone X. I would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.	1
1025	It's alright....	1
1026	Unfortunately it did not work.	0

1042	The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.	0
1043	Love this little dot with a screen.  Super easy to set up and easy to use.  Instantly connected to all my other echo products.  I also bought the screen cover that has the blocking button for the camera if you want to use it.  Recommended.	1

1050	Love it!! Super fun! Easy to use! My three year old even gets involved	1
1051	it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself	1

1059	I love it!	1
1060	Loved it!	1
1061	I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  	0
1062	I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.	0
1063	Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?	0

1068	It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.	0
1069	Easy setup  Love it!	1
1070	Works well. Need to speak clearly but picks up commands from a good distance and the sound is surprisingly well.	1
1071	The selection is wonderful and the ease of use on the home page is nice. I wish, however, it didn't keep overcoming my settings for my other devices attached to my TV.  I have to keep switching back after any switches in programming, including my stereo.	1
1072	Just got mine last night. Played around with it for a while. Should have bought it a long time ago.	1
1073	The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1
1074	The story line is just awful!  	0
1075	I have been hesitant to purchase anything smart home because I am just not good with electronics.  However this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the Bluetooth in my sound bar for my TV which provides extra sound for music, I can make calls and finally hear people when home. I do not have cable, only the paid apps like Netflix and Hulu so when Alexa provided me news stations, weather and other updates it was really great to hear! I have linked all of my accounts to her, she turns on my lights before I walk through the door. She purchases re-orders off of Amazon for my pets and I heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to 911 regardless if she was unplugged or not.  This is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone.  My tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her. Must buy!!!	1

1091	Fairly easy to use	1
1092	I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol	1
1093	Alexa rocks	1

1099	The food wasn't good.	0
1100	Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  	1

1102	Enjoy using it.  Great sound.  Love the shopping list	1
1103	Does everything it should and more.	1
1104	Good product.	1
1105	I absolutely love my Show!	1
1106	Although this is my second echo device, I am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentation/instructions as to the many functions of the device.  I purchased becausse of the sound quality, but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident.  There needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device.  Or at least point out where it can be found...	1
1107	It's not as good as Siri, BUT it still has some positives, it's great at playing music, and setting alarms. I personally felt that I paid too much for this product, as it was nearly half off on prime day (literally the day after I purchased it). So I'm pretty disappointed. I might still return it and get my money back. .	0
1108	I love to watch my wife argue with Alexa.  I woke up one night listening to Alexa talking to my cell phone. ????	1
1109	Very disappointing!!!	0
1110	Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered.	1

1115	Set up was simple. It recognizes my voice well. It seams very intuitive. I am enjoying its ease of use.	1
1116	I love the Echo Spot. This bedside alarm clock size device can do what theEcho Show can do. I was concerned because I already had a large Echo in mybedroom that answered to “Alexa” like the other devices in my home. I wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when I discoveredthat I had other name choices (not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion).I named him “Echo.” Now if I could only choose a male voice. I loved that I could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell. So many more features. Don’t forget to buy thestand/base. So many advantages to having that. Read the reviews. Highly recommend.	1
1117	Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).	0
1118	I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.	0
1119	It's louder than the dot and it's got a built in hub for all the other wireless controls in the house.	1
1120	I am very happy	1
1121	All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	0
1122	I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!	1
1123	The camera really likes her in this movie.  	1
1124	I got this for my mom . She loves it !	1
1125	The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  	1

1131	It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  	1
1132	Responds easily and like the ability to do at night.	1
1133	Works great as a BT receiver with output connected to vintage stereo equipment.	1
1134	Amazing!	1
1135	Not bad bad speaker for sound	1

1140	Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  	1
1141	This thing is awesome!  I got it on Prime Day for a great deal.  I wish I had purchased two.  I also bought the Echo Show version, but the sound is not nearly as good as the Echo Plus.  The Echo Show came dented, so I will be exchanging it.  I like the screen and many of the features so I will not be getting a refund.  It was still worth the price.	1
1142	Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  	0
1143	Got this for my 2nd Echo in the house, I already have the regular Echo.  The Echo Dot was easy to set up but the sound is not enjoyable, wishing I would have just gone with another regular Echo solely based on sound.	1
1144	We definately enjoyed ourselves.	1
1145	Not all that happy. The speaker isn’t great and for some reason a lot of times when I play music it will start to make some weird noise and just stop. My son has a google home and it is much better	0
1146	Luv it.  It's a great product.	1
1147	Don't do it!!!!	0
1148	I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won't regret this at all!	1

1159	Second dot.	1
1160	Love, love so far. I just received it Thursday. I unwrapped it, set it up, & immediately programmed it. No problem with the reoccurring things to try. I set it to rotate once and shows time like I want. I love the low ambient look at night.	1
1161	We will not be coming back.	0
1162	Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  	0
1163	We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
1164	I can say that the desserts were yummy.	1
1165	Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.	1
1166	Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.	1
1167	Fun so far...still learning how it all works	1

1177	I liked linking two more rooms in the home	1
1178	Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  	1
1179	Nice headphones for the price and they work great!	1
1180	Good quality, great sound quality	1
1181	My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.	1
1182	All in all I think it was a good investment.	1
1183	The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  	0
1184	I bought this for myself and i didn’t realize it had to be plugged in just to work. It isn’t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall. It should’ve been more clear when i bought it.	0
1185	I love all of the things that it can do. I can play with it and learn from it.	1

1197	Cool little speaker..I love her alarms and connected it to my speakers and it sounds great!!	1
1198	Just like new, set-up was quick & easy.	1
1199	Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.	0
1200	My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	1
1201	My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)	0
1202	Easy to set up	1
1203	Love my Alexa Echo Dot - I have two of them now - one new, one refurbished.  Both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things.  I love it as an alarm every morning or whenever.  I love it to play music or sounds of the ocean, or nature sounds when I am trying to sleep.  Just love it for so many things.	1

1210	"""Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, """"you see kids..."""" Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  """	0
1211	I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.	1
1212	The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.	1
1213	Love this thing. People think I’m crazy for paying this much for a glorified alarm clock. But I don’t care!! For me, waking up in a good mood is pretty important and this helps me do it!! So glad I don’t have to deal with my old EEAANH EEAANH EEAANH alarm. Very excited to say “Alexa, turn off the lights” (smart plugs get here soon!) Got a camera privacy slide for this since it is in my bedroom.	1
1214	Small speaker tin sound. Great with good Bluetooth speaker.	1
1215	Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube.	1
1216	But not very loud	1
1217	The worst one of the series.  	0
1218	I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  	1
1219	To have ability to play Amazon Music outside for patio gatherings. I also used blue tooth to connect Echo Plus via Alexa App on my tablet to an external speaker when/if the party extends into the yard. I have plans to connect other devices such as thermostat and other lighting and home devices.	1
1220	Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.	1
1221	Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.	1
1222	Easy installation and set up. Better sound from the Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified with purchase.	1
1223	My three year old loves it.  Good for doing basic household tasks.  We're going to add a few smart outlets and bulbs.	1
1224	If you haven't gone here GO NOW!	1
1225	excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns	1
1226	I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won't regret this at all!	1
1227	Better Than New.	1
1228	Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0
1229	I used it as an alarm clock  i lov it	1
1230	The plug did not work very well.	0
1231	They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	1
1232	plays great	1
1233	The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.	1
1234	"""Handy if you don't expect much out of it much """"dumber"""" than the assistant in my phone."""	1
1235	Love my Echo great sound very smart!	1
1236	Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!	1
1237	Cool	1
1238	It's a sad movie, but very good.  	1

1247	"""So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or """"skills"""", but getting the hang of it."""	1
1248	The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  	1
1249	What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.	0
1250	The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  	0
1251	This echo spot is great I love it	1
1252	Echo Spot works well except it does not work with the Ring doorbell as it states on the website. Since they were sold as a pair I thought that it would be app ready.  Unfortunately that is not case.  Perhaps Ring will update so that they can be integrated.	1
1253	The lighting is awful.  	0
1254	One problem you need to buy an app from amazon to mirroring your iphone .. app price 2.99$ .. other than that the device is perfect	1
1255	My friend loved the salmon tartar.	1
1256	Still learning everything she can do.  Good for a room.  Volume is pretty good without an additional speaker	1
1257	excellent device , works great, having no problems or concerns	1
1258	Very happy with this product.	1
1259	This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  	1
1260	It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.	1
1261	We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.	1
1262	Alexa is phenomenal!	1
1263	However I needed some better instructions.	0
1264	It has been a winner for us.	1
1265	Easy set up	1
1266	"""I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying """"what?"""""""	0
1267	Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  	0
1268	Bought for my older grandparent to help with reminders. Would recommend to anyone with someone in their life with dementia or memory loss. Helps my grandmother remember to take medications and do daily task. She loves it because she can listen to music and ask questions	1
1269	I really love my dots! So awesome how it’s connects all my rooms. But like you’ve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I’m sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don’t pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%	1
1270	However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.	0
1271	Powerful little stick	1
1272	We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.	1
1273	Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  	1
1274	I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!	1
1275	Great sound and video plus all the great stuff that Alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off	1
1276	I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!	1
1277	Using it to stream Amazon Prime and Netflix.	1
1278	So far it has been fun to use and learn how to deal with Alexa. I am still learning and finding out what can really be done, plus I am in the process of making my house a smart house, so there is no much to control with Alexa yet.	1
1279	Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  	1
1280	I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  	1
1281	Love my echo dot!!!	1
1282	I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier	1
1283	The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.	0
1284	Easy to set up, lots of things to watch and program in.  Have not even gotten that far into it yet.  Easy to use. Highly recommended.  Leaning more and more closer to cutting the cable cord for good.	1
1285	I love this, answers all my stupid questions and tells me the weather for when I don’t get off the couch	1
1286	Worked perfectly!	1
1287	Nope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm.. I dont know that.	0
1288	The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.	1
1289	Very easy to set up and straight forward directions. Loads fast also.	1
1290	I love all the viewing choices on FIRE STICK!	1
1291	Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.	0
1292	Great device, my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me!	1
1293	I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.	1
1294	Bought this for my son and it didn’t work. He had to return it.	0
1295	I like it and it’s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.	1
1296	I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
1297	It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!	1
1298	If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	1
1299	An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.	1
1300	But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  	0
1301	The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.	1
1302	The sound quality is excellent as well.	1
1303	Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	0
1304	It is zillion times away from reality.  	0
1305	Love it!	1
1306	I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa	1
1307	Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  	1
1308	I love this thing! It plays my books from audible or prime music and sets my alarms! If you’re considering purchasing one, get it. It’s worth it.	1
1309	People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.	0
1310	Luv it.  It's a great product.	1
1311	Great device, responsive and helpful	1
1312	Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!	1
1313	W810i is just SUPERB.	1
1314	It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).	0
1315	It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.	1
1316	This place should honestly be blown up.	0
1317	love it...just like the other 4 I own.	1
1318	Very easy to set up and use. Slowly adding devices to truly make our house a smart home. Both Alexa and I are learning what we can do.  With each new item I am happier that I made the purchase.  So far my only regret is I didn’t do it sooner.	1
1319	Beyond my capabilities to program. Grandkids lve it	1
1320	Its work perfect an I must introduce the rest of the device to complete the functions.	1
1321	I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.	1
1322	I love the Echo Show. I’m going off to live on campus for school in the fall and we got two of these to serve as an easy way to connect. Some people might not like the camera but that makes little sense. We carry devices with cameras all the time. The only difference here is that the item is stationary. My family and I also find the drop-in feature a comfort rather than an invasion of privacy. It’s definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versa.I’d also like to thank Amazon for including their VoiceView screen reader on the device. The Show would be a lot less blind friendly, even with Alexa present, if they hadn’t included that.We are an echo-loving household with two dots, three echos, and now two Shows. I wouldn’t be surprised if we got more in the future for ourselves or loved ones. Thanks, Amazon!	1
1323	Won't go back.	0
1324	I like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.	1
1325	It looks very nice.	1
1326	The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  	0
1327	I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.	0
1328	Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	1
1329	I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  	0
1330	Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password	0
1331	Battery has no life.	0
1332	It was harder to setup then I thought it should be, for some reason I had to default  it twice. Had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices. Would be nice if it could interact with my Xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my Xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras, be nice set and disarm the alarm with Alexa. Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it's fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you.	0
1333	Works great!	1
1334	I took advantage of prime Friday and decided to take a chance and purchase one.  I enjoy the features it comes with. I'm sorry I didn't purchase two of them  Well worth the money.  Its looks great on my nightstand.  Every night it puts me to steep with sleeping music.  Happy customer!	1
1335	I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
1336	We have used for last 2 weeks. We like it. My children also like it. Alexa has become part of our family.	1
1337	Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.	0
1338	An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	1
1339	For as awesome as the Echo and Echo Dots are, the Spot is a disappointment. There is very little control over what the screen shows, what the clock looks like, what order things show up in, etc. At this point if I hadn't thrown the box away immediately, I would have sent it back and just got another full size Echo.	0
1340	The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.	1
1341	He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.	1
1342	Kids love it! I love it!	1

1345	I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.	1
1346	Restored my phone to like new performance.	1
1347	Food was delicious!	1
1348	I love all the features and form factor.	1
1349	The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.	1
1350	The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.	1
1351	Good	1
1352	I like Alexa	1

1358	Love it!! It is so handy and easy to use. Got it for my classroom, but I many need to just get another one.	1
1359	Fantastic service here.	1
1360	The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.	1

1364	Love my Echo	1
1365	I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	1
1366	It has replaced my clock and Google Mini on my nightstand.  Outstanding little device.  I hope an update will give a simple face and font color options for the clock.	1
1367	Being able to add speakers is a plus. I take it on my deck when I am outside. Just love it. I have my big Alexia in my bedroom	1
1368	Love it. Added it to an upstairs bedroom	1
1369	However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	0
1370	Easy to use	1

1372	Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!	1
1373	Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  	0
1374	Works decent, wish it was able to answer more questions....need a better source for info but the rest works great!	1
1375	Works better than anticipated. This thing is awesome.	1
1376	Great product. Love the larger remote! Great deal!	1
1377	Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	0
1378	Have now used for several months without problem.	1
1379	It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  	1
1380	It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.	0
1381	Perfect	1
1382	And none of the tones is acceptable.	0

1385	I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  	0
1386	We have six of these throughout our home and they are great.  There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.	1
1387	Excelente su funcionamiento y llama la atención la rapidez de respuesta y el control que se logra a través de la utilización con Alexa. Me sorprendió gratamente. Muy recomendable.	1

1389	The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  	1
1390	I highly recommend the spot! I have it connected to the kasa camera and it is so convenient to just ask spot to, &#34;show me the camera&#34; when someone is at the door. Love it! As soon as amazon has a good sale on these again I will be getting another one! Good job Amazon!	1
1391	It was just too horrible.  	0
1392	Love my Echo Show. Alexa is amazing and now on the Show &#34;she&#34; can display lyrics, photos, etc. The speakers are amazing and fills the room. Bought on Prime Day so got a great deal, so worth it.	1
1393	poor quality and service.	0
1394	It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better.	1
1395	I’m really enjoying this product. Love the flash briefing, the timers, the weather reports and more.	1
1396	I think it can read my mind	1
1397	great	1

1416	I found this product to be waaay too big.	0
1417	Love my fire stick and remote, so easy to set up and use. Endless amounts of apps to download! Used it with my smart tv and it’s 100X better than the features smart TVs offer	1
1418	Why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV's and many other devices?  I want my money back!  This thing won't even turn on my TV unless I buy another hub.  What's the point of having a hub that doesn't support half the devices out there?  DON'T buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub.  It won't work with many of your devices.  Just by the Echo or Dot if you must but not this.  Better yet, get a Google device.  They actually understand you when you talk.	0
1419	Oh I love my Echo Show and the video news spots	1

1426	We gave the Echo Spot as a gift to my mother in law.  She loves it.  She can play music of all genres!  Easy for her to use.	1

1428	Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.	1
1429	Love it , Now if I can only find the correct smart (links)Plug to connect this too	1
1430	Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.	1
1431	I had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone. I ended up using my computer. It is interesting that the answers come from Wikipedia. However, I will give Echo dot an &#34;A&#34; in the music playing department. I heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations. Also amusing when Alexa responds, I don't know that. Why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing???? If I had paid full price for this gadget I would have been sorely disappointed. Now it seems reasonable and a step above HAL.	1
1432	I love it...... I want to get another one very  very  soon	1
1433	First time using Alexa and so far I love it.	1
1434	No complaints!	1
1435	I love the echo show awesome speakers I love the fact when you listen to music the words come up all around liking it so far. Also being able to read what's on your shopping list to do list and notifications	1
1436	(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	0
1437	Love it!!!	1
1438	Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station. Motown isn’t close to salsa phonetically.	0
1439	I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)	1
1440	Can't upload ringtones from a third party.	0
1441	Fantastic product, I use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly, the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program	1

1447	MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  	1
1448	Its very nice	1
1449	Great sound from a little speaker	1
1450	Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.	1
1451	Satisfied with the purchase	1
1452	We love the echo spot I use it on my nightstand for alarm clock and play iHeartRadio radio while getting dressed!!	1
1453	Works great.	1
1454	Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.	1
1455	What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...	0
1456	I am a small business owner with no staff. With the Alexa driven Echo Spot, I feel like I've hired my first assistant! My Echo Spot keeps me organized, updated, and assistance when I need information that will help my day run more smoothly. I love my Echo Spot so much, I bought 2 more for my kids who love their Echo Spot too! I highly recommend this product.Suggested improvement for future versions, make the Echo Spot wireless. 😊	1
1457	I used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos	1
1458	I love it pretty cool.	1
1459	The kids are annoying.  	0
1460	Still learning it. We have just started integrating the smart devices in our home with the Echo product line. We now have the Show, the Spot, two Dots and a kids Dot. Having trouble getting them to call each other but still working on it.	1
1461	Happy with Echo Plus. Having fun learning what I can do with it.	1
1462	Great item.  I'm so glad I made the purchase and on Prime day.	1
1463	I needed an alarm clock and this fit the bill perfectly.  I am a believer in amazon echo, Alexa and fire.  Great customization options and Alexa is always helpful.  Sound quality is also surprisingly good.	1
1464	Love our echo	1
1465	Fantastic product, I use it as a smart home hub and to play music through speakers mainly, the customizable routines are so nice and very easy to program	1
1466	This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
1467	I do love it. Was easy to set up so far, but I wish it has a little more in the set up instructions. There is still a whole lot more I would like to be able to do with it and I have no idea if I can or not with it. But I really do like it.	1
1468	Love it	1
1469	Adding more rooms for convenience	1
1470	The volume is very low	0
1471	It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  	0
1472	It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.	0

1475	Highly recommended.	1
1476	I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.	1
1477	Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.	0
1478	It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  	0
1479	Was surprised to learn this can be used as a Bluetooth speaker for phones and tablets... it probably lists it in the description, but I missed that part!  It not quite the surround-like quality of a Bluetooth speaker in the $100+ range, but its very good none the less.  And with even basic access to Amazon Music there is a lot to listen to.  There's a huge number of things Alexa can do, learning more every day.	1
1480	Small convenient and dependable. This dot is a cutie and Alexa does the job you ask.My only issue is the fidelity which is to be expected in a such a small speaker	1
1481	The design is very good.4.	1
1482	My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.	1
1483	Easy to install. Up and running in minutes.	1
1484	Purchased this for a discount on Prime Day to insert into a portable Bluetooth speaker made specifically to work with Echo Dot. Works great, love it! Now I can bring Alexa out onto the patio with me, and I mostly use it for music. This is our 3rd Echo product and we love them!	1
1485	I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!	1
1486	This is our second Echo Spot - to go with out two Echo Dots - love the look and how Alexia responds.	1
1487	I am just entering the &#34;smart&#34; technology world. I haven't figured it all out yet, but so far it's pretty cool!	1

1494	Love my echo show! Great sound and picture. Does a great job thing in my entire echo collection!	1
1495	Good device	1
1496	There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  	0
1497	Nothing to dislike I love my new toy that has made my house a smart home.	1
1498	The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  	1
1499	Currently own 3 Chromecast devices and tge Fire Stick is superior to them.  We are so pleased that we can watch programs on Netflix and Prime without a smart phone or computer.  Very easy to install and use!	1

1502	it takes a while to learn the uses and I'm still learning!	1
1503	I own 5 Echo devices, consider me addicted! This little number is awesome, not only do I like that it displays, the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other Echo devices. One feature I really like is how it slowly dims after I turn off my bedroom light, so I have a night light for a bit. I love Echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them!	1
1504	Nice. It works good.Some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times, some time almost screaming.	1
1505	I reached out to Amazon, because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use.  Customer service couldn't help they basically told me to contact Sprint to assist.  So Echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up, so its kind of pointless to have and pay for.	0
1506	I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again.	0
1507	Excellent starter wireless headset.	0
1508	The reception has been generally good.	1
1509	Ease of set up. I’ll have fun sitting up other features as well as making my house a smart home.	1
1510	Great product. I have two and may want to buy a third!	1
1511	I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
1512	In a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house. Extrimelly useful hub of information, music, automation, communication, and assistant in basic needs. Would love to have a voice personalization. Some things are better not to said aloud but typed (like door unlocking codes) but that is problem of unwitty developers. So far only positive experience. The privacy invasions is happened way before Alexa, it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier. To Alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off.	1
1513	My headset works just peachy-keen.	1

1519	Love it l. I plan on getting an echo for the kitchen.	1
1520	Works great! I recommend it to anyone who has prime, WiFi and an hdm1 tv. That’s all u need. I’m not really technologically savvy but even I was able to set it up with included and on screen directions.	1
1521	With the combination of this, smart plugins, and the Alex app I can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling Alexa to do it. I can order stuff, get answers, watch videos, get weather, set alarms, video call, and so much more with this device!	1
1522	Excellent cast, story line, performances.  	1

1529	I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!	1

1532	Perfect for kids, adults and everyone in between!!	1
1533	We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0
1534	Nice product A+	1
1535	Only complaint I have is that the sound quality isn't great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to play music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don't mind the audio quality, but if you're bothered by that kind of thing I'd go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers.	1
1536	I love this product so far only because of the few things I can do with it...such as set a timer, a reminder, play music and games. I don't like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things. It was also very difficult to set up. The directions made it sound as simple as one, two, three but they forgot about step four, five and six. I was almost ready to send to back.The app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up. However depending on what you are going to be using it for I think it's an ok item.	1
1537	The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues.	1
1538	Bad Quality.	0
1539	love it	1
1540	We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.	1
1541	I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.	1
1542	Love this!	1
1543	I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade.	1
1544	I was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement .  The display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this task.The display works well for camera viewing.It is an attractive device. and a decent value at $99	1
1545	The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
1546	Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.	1
1547	Easy set up, nice looking interface and I like the new slightly larger remote. I have a 1st Gen with the little remote and misplace it all the time. And great price!	1
1548	I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you	1
1549	Have had for just one week so far and I can say it is a blast to have.	1
1550	I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0
1551	This is a great device. We mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to Red Alert or make the TARDIS land (yes, we're a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;Computer&#34; instead of &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now we just need Majel Barret's voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It's not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it's still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. Plus it's fun knowing the NSA is listening to everything.	1
1552	Wasn't so sure about bringing &#34;smart technology&#34; into my home, but I'm hooked! I love the sleek look of the Echo Spot on my nightstand and how easy it was to set up and use. I also love that it scrolls the news, local weather, and give suggestions of what to ask Alexa. I use this as my alarm clock, speaker, and have it sync'd with the Etekcity Voltson Wi-Fi Smart Plugs to control the lighting in my apartment.	1
1553	i do wish the dot could connect to the fire stick but both products still worked flawlessly	1
1554	The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder.	1

1560	Love this!!! My daughter enjoys telling Alexa what to do. Haha	1
1561	Met every expectation I had	1
1562	Works well with optional cameras.  Conferencing is good.  Still feel like Bezos is spying on me.	1
1563	I love love love it.	1
1564	I am really enjoying the many different features on my Alexa, especially listening to music and audio books	1
1565	I like that it respond most of my comands. Great product.	1
1566	I was hoping the cord was white also. Otherwise it is fine.	1
1567	This thing barely works. You have to select 3rd party apps to do stuff you'd think it could do out of the box. I'm sending mine back asap. Waste of money.	0
1568	There's really no dislike for Alexa( dot) I thought cortna was cool but Alexa is an awesome application to the family. Unbelievable device which seems alive. A must get.	1
1569	Worked just as good as the two new Echo Dots i preciously purchases.	1

1592	I wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live.  The speech recognition software is horrible.  My wife and i both are native Americans whose language is English she is from the north i am from Texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us.  We bought two they do the same thing.  Additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. I had to buy Wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router.  Both had problems Switched them around no difference.  So it they are now disconnected dust collectors.	0
1593	It will drive you barking mad!  	0
1594	Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0
1595	The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.	1
1596	Echo Show is perfect for staging in the kitchen so recipes are right there. No need to print them. Wonderful device. Acoustical sounds are not as powerful as our tall cylindercal echo but we have that covered in the adjacent family room.	1
1597	Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  	1

1614	Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	1
1615	Works as advertised. Speak clearly, and research the commands. Also. Get the wall holder, it keeps it out of the way. Set up is a breeze, just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone. For some reason it made set up easier...though it could be psychological haha	1

1627	I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we’ll keep it..	1
1628	One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	1

1632	Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  	1
1633	Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  	1
1634	Great fun but frustrating at times. Commands between tv and the show get mixed (asking to watch something will turn my directv, not display on show which stinks with an 8 year old) Also would like more video options with flash briefings. Still really a tech wonder for a low price.	1

1648	Incredible piece of technology.I have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. The mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. I connected the Echo via Bluetooth to my Sony soundbar on my TV but find the Echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. It's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. The sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. The knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. This is my first Echo device and I would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the Echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. For that alone I would recommend this over the regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. The rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.This order came with a free Philips Hue Bulb which I installed along with an extra one I bought. I put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all I had to do was say &#34;Alexa, connect my devices&#34;. The default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34;, so I can have a dimmer floor lamp if I just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;Alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. In the Alexa app, I created a 'Group' with &#34;First light&#34; and &#34;Second light&#34; and named the group &#34;The light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining I just say &#34;Alexa, turn on The light&#34;.I was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the Echo Plus with its built in hub. I thought I would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. Apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! I was surprised by that. Awesome.You will feel like Tony Stark on this device. I added quite a few &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' and 'Quote of the day' . Alexa always loads them up quickly. Adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on Amazon Music is also a great feature.I can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.I was lucky to buy this for $100 on Prime Day, but I think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the Echo 2 is only $100. In my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the Echo Plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) Taller and 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob on top that you spin (I think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) Built in hub for Hue bulbs. After researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. For me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.I highly recommend it and will buy an Echo dot for my bedroom now.	1

1653	Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  	1
1654	The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.	1
1655	This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.	1
1656	Easy setup very fun to use. Connects with all my smart home appliances	1
1657	Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.	1
1658	Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all, this is a fabulous speaker.	1
1659	There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	0
1660	If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  	0
1661	Doesn't hold charge.	0
1662	It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.	1
1663	Service stinks here!	0
1664	Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!	1

1672	Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.	1
1673	Poor quality.	0
1674	Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  	0

1687	I am the Training Coordinator at my company and I have used the Amazon Blueprints skill with an Echo device and Echo Buttons to create my own Gameshow/Quiz for new hire orientation training. I'm always looking for new ways to engage trainees in order to make learning more enjoyable. I believe that if someone enjoys the process of learning then they're much more likely to remember the information. So far, this has been a huge success with my classes and I look forward to Amazon improving and building out the Blueprints skill further!	1
1688	This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  	0
1689	Same specs as regular echo, but easier to use than getting a separate hub for smart lights, etc.	1
1690	Great Product	1
1691	I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
1692	This product just looks adorable in any room and I love it. I recently just bought my mom one as a gift on Prime Day and she can't wait to use it.	1
1693	It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?	1
1694	After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0

1696	Jawbone Era is awesome too!	1
1697	Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.	0
1698	I'm amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.	1
1699	Love the Echo Dot. Helps husband get Netflix and other apps on our Amazon Fire TV.  No problems with it being refurbished. Planning on getting another one for the Amazon Fire Stick in bedroom.	1
1700	very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.	1
1701	love it	1
1702	This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!	1
1703	It works just like my other Dots.	1
1704	Great product at a great price.	1
1705	I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!	1
1706	Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	0
1707	The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.	1
1708	Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.	1
1709	It was a little hard to follow their instructions, great product	1
1710	Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  	0
1711	Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password	0
1712	Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	0
1713	Sooooo good!!	1
1714	Great addition to the Alexa family.  Nice having the &#34;visual&#34; part of pics, recipes, etc.	1
1715	So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.	1
1716	Bought this for the guest room.  It's a radio, alarm clock, information​ center and so much more.	1
1717	Upgraded from an original Echo on Prime Day and so far I love it. I'm sure I have a long way to go to maximize its utility,  but for now I owe my marked increase in lyrical knowledge to this thing. Who knew Post Malone actually used words?!	1
1718	Never going back.	0
1719	Invasive and scared the crap out of me for speaking when it was not spoken to! CREAPY AF	0
1720	Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended	1
1721	Love it.. makes the simple things in life simpler	1
1722	Nothing to dislike and it does a lot more than I expected	1
1723	Thank you for such great service.	1
1724	I’m impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it’s definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can’t use my Apple Music account.	1
1725	Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	1
1726	Dont waste your money...	0
1727	Able to watch all of the shows I love and more.	1
1728	I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.	1
1729	I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  	1
1730	The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
1731	No plot whatsoever!  	0
1732	Convenient and fun.	1
1733	It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.	0
1734	Home entertainment	1
1735	Initially, this echo dot worked very well. Over time, the dot stopped responding to 'alexa' unless you were within one foot of it yelling. The other echos/echo dots in other rooms would respond without a response from this echo dot. Would not recommend buying refurbished.	0
1736	This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  	1
1737	This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
1738	Comfort for our whole family.	1
1739	I do love these things, i have them running my entire home, TV, all my lights, my thermostat, my front door dead bolt, the cameras... and i love listening to npr. these things are well worth the value and they really shine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek.... I named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems.	1
1740	Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It’s great for my news updates too!	1
1741	I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	0
1742	But the service was beyond bad.	0
1743	I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  	0
1744	This place is amazing!	1
1745	No buyers remorse on this one!.	0
1746	I love searching the Alexa skill shop on the app. Useful things like having Alexa turn my lights on and off, listening to news updates every morning. And fun stuff like telling Alexa to make the Star Trek red alert nois. Or playing song quiz with friends.	1
1747	neat tool we enjoy it with the family	1
1748	Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.	1
1749	So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0
1750	Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.	1

1756	I love my echo dot! Looks brand new and works perfect! Very satisfied.	1
1757	AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.	0
1758	I love the Echo Spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things, but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom!	1
1759	Bought the 2nd firestick for bedroom. Easily installed and set up. Works great	1
1760	Love everything about this product I bought two one for my household and one for my mother in law just so we can video chat with her and for emergency and it’s easy to use for older folks.	1
1761	Gave it my daughter for her birthday, she loves it! Sound is amazing, she plays music on it constantly. Worth every penny. This is the third amazon device purchased, we have 2 echo shows and now the spot.	1
1762	WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.	0
1763	The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  	0
1764	I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	0
1765	The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
1766	The current demand for this stick, was too high for the power coming out of my USB port on the TV. Had to run the power cable to the supplied USB adapter. Not a big deal but added another cable showing on my wall mounted TV.	1
1767	What a big waste of time.	0
1768	I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!  It’s just what l needed and MORE!!!  I didn’t realize that the remote included voice remote.  HOW CONVENIENT!!!!  I’m so glad that l made that purchase!!!!	1
1769	We really love our Echo Dot, we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of.	1
1770	Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  	0
1771	All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.	0
1772	I love this device! It's so great. What a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing YouTube videos, and Google play music. The camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and it's dark in the room.Other than those minor things, I love it. Great buy and would buy again	1
1773	Nice product A+	1
1774	I purchased the Fire Stick to be able to watch movies at my convenience. I love that there is such a variety of genres. I also enjoy it gives you the ability to watch TV shows too. It's Awesome!	1
1775	Really pleased with this product so far.	1
1776	Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  	1
1777	This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)	1
1778	Works great!	1
1779	The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.	1
1780	Great product. So many features.	1
1781	Very good quality	1
1782	I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.	0
1783	I wanted to use this as a bedside clock with the ability to play music and podcasts. Sadly, it continuously scrolls the &#34;Things to try&#34; and won't stay on the clock face. Amazon is about to get this one back.	0

1793	I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  	0
1794	It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  	1
1795	I don't know why I held out on getting this for so long.	1

1797	My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.	0
1798	Perfect for the PS3.	1
1799	I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1
1800	Overall, I like there food and the service.	1
1801	Not very loud but quality and ease of use is great. Sound is perfect for background music, would suggest 2-or more connected together if you’re trying to use for hosting a louder party	1
1802	Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.	1
1803	Very convenient	1

1814	It's a great product with many good aspects, it easy to setup and control with intuitive straight forward instructions. The included lightbulb was excellent and worked perfectly. I very much enjoy this product and recommend it.	1
1815	Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.	1
1816	Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.	1
1817	There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  	0
1818	I am not easily impressed with electronic goodies. But...OMG this is by far the coolest thing I have ever had.  It does everything short of clean your house... which, when I asked Alexa to clean my house.... was told she didn’t have hands, but instead played a fantastic playlist for cleaning!  From reading books to my five year old, to video chat, to silly selfies, music that automatically goes to my Bose Bluetooth speaker, setting timers, alarms, changing my thermostat on voice command, tells me the weather, sends hubby a grocery pick up list, and I am sure. Million more things!BUY IT.....you u will not regret it.	1
1819	NOT WHAT I WANTED.	0
1820	I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!	1
1821	It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  	0

1845	Good product	1
1846	Love it but the volume could definitely use a boost. If it had better built in speaker's, would definitively be a 5 star. They thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input, so I bought a dedicated speaker for the Echo. Proved to be best way to go.	1
1847	I LOVE ALEXA!! SHE ROCKS!!!	1

1850	Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  	1
1851	love it	1
1852	It is as if we are having a conversation with another person.  Instantaneous response.  And the fact that it catches your command even when you're far from it is simply just amazing.	1
1853	This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!	1

1881	I love the idea is the star trek computer at home. The skills are great, but the natural language work is mediocre.	1

1898	And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  	0
1899	I got this for dad on father's Day!  He was tickled with it!	1
1900	Love it to play music works great for finding recipes. Need more family to have adapted machines to see	1
1901	Boy was that sucker dry!!.	0
1902	Primarily for music in our bedroom.  I wish the speaker had better fidelity.	1
1903	This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.	1
1904	The case is great and works fine with the 680.	1
1905	i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.	1
1906	It works great!!	1
1907	I like the volume up and down on the top so I can turn it down quickly.	1
1908	For the size of the screen this thing should be $25	0
1909	The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	1
1910	I got my Echo Spot on Prime Day and love it. I think it still is a little expensive, but the chance to save $30 convinced me to buy it. I basically use it as a radio alarm clock because on my old radio the stations would sometimes not come in clearly. I also like the sleep sounds skill, and hearing the weather. I'm still exploring the other skills...just discovered some Star Trek sounds (Alexa, beam me up) which are fun!	1
1911	Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc.	1
1912	I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0
1913	There are some generally great things in it.  	1
1914	Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!	1
1915	Works great and has been fun to use.	1
1916	Easy to set up and connect with smart devices. Just what I needed!	1
1917	Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!	1
1918	The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	1
1919	They have a really nice atmosphere.	1
1920	One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  	0
1921	Love that you can use your cell phone to call Echo or Dot. You can also use Echo and Dot as intercoms.	1
1922	The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	0
1923	It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.	1
1924	The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	0
1925	I was a little apprehensive about buying this because I saw reviews saying it sounds like crap. I'm no audiophile by any means so maybe it's that, but I think it sounds great considering the size. It fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear. I haven't had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands. I have it paired to an EcoBee3, my Firestick, and a Phillip's Hue light bulb. I plan on adding devices as I go. I love this thing and I'm glad I scooped it up! I have only had it around 2 weeks. Will update if I run into issues.	1
1926	Good but it’s pretty low	1
1927	Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.	0
1928	The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.	0
1929	Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.	0
1930	Device has great speakers and the screen quality is phenomenal.	1
1931	A great film by a great director.  	1

1933	For that, it's worth checking out.  	1
1934	She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great	1
1935	I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  	0
1936	20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  	0

1940	The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won’t be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.	0
1941	It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.	1
1942	Lasted one day and then blew up.	0
1943	I would recommend it.	1
1944	Brilliant!  	1
1945	I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself	1
1946	This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc.	1
1947	This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  	1
1948	Alexa is phenomenal!	1
1949	It is a great bundle of fun. Music ,games, questions etc. I luv it turns off my smart lights. I purchase 4 more smart light for my lamps in the living room and my room!	1

1957	My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running.	1

1959	Awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life. Great purchase.	1
1960	Alexa hardly came on..	0
1961	I had a brand new echo Dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good. It was quite different from my expectations. Refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while I realized that the power adapter was faulty. There is no way for me to have Amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options. I love Amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down.Update: Amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter. This is why I shop on Amazon. I can always trust them to deliver on their products.	1
1962	i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  	0
1963	my new best friend :)	1
1964	It has a nice speaker.	1

1966	Just what I expected....	1
1967	It good	1
1968	It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.	0
1969	This is our 5th Amazon Echo device.  We have purchased refurbished before and been satisfied, this time is no different.  You can't tell this from brand new, and the price was $10 cheaper.  Our Echo's wake us up, keep timers, play music for us, act as encyclopedias, turn our lights on and off and so much more.	1
1970	Ask it to play Motown radio on Pandora and it keeps asking if I want to add a salsa station. Motown isn’t close to salsa phonetically.	0
1971	A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.	1
1972	1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.	0
1973	Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	0
1974	Gave as a gift - they loved it.	1
1975	Alexa Show is amazing. My wife hated that I bought it, thought we didn't need it and after a day she fell in love with Alexa too lol. It is so convenient for setting timers, listening to music, playing music for the dog while im not home, connecting to bluetooth speakers for parties, playing movies. I love it!	1
1976	This is great! Got one for my Gazebo and one upstairs.	1
1977	I hope this place sticks around.	1

1981	Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.	0
1982	No issues...works and looks great!!!	1
1983	This one's going in the kitchen for timer/music duty.	1
1984	Echo Show is my personal assistant! Awesome!!!	1
1985	Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
1986	They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	1
1987	This thing is great. Has good sound and does everything I expected. I have it linked in with my lights and use it with alarm.com as well.	1
1988	My favorite Echo. A more than adequate replacement for a clock radio.	1
1989	It knows everything  we ask it to do. Havent smart hubbed it yet but does exactly as advertised and am very happy with our purchase. Sound quality is excellent also	1
1990	We won't be going back anytime soon!	0
1991	LOVE it. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and his kids have a blast asking Alexa all kinds of questions and having her tell silly jokes. We love it.	1
1992	Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  	1
1993	I love all that you can do with the Echo Spot!	1
1994	will definitely be back!	1
1995	While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  	1
1996	I love this! It’s user friendly and better than any streaming device we have previously used. I wish we had purchased sooner and purchased more of them.	1
1997	I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.	1
1998	"""An Italian reviewer called this """"a small, great film,"""" and that's right.  """	1
1999	I received an Echo as a gift, loved it so much I decided to get the Dot for my bedroom. Both very easy to set up but a big difference in the sound quality. I would still buy it again.	1
2000	Love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . Just as good as Bose speakers around house -	1
2001	The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.	1
2002	The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.	1
2003	I've dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).	1
2004	works better than I thought	1

2009	I bought two.  One for me and one for my daughter who lives in another state.  We love it!!	1
2010	Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It’s great for my news updates too!	1
2011	I don't like how I cannot load my Hulu account, it is also very slow. I know it is not my Internet connection because I have an Xbox One that works just fine, but my Fire TV Stick takes forever to load anything.	0

2016	Works great I bought this Direct from amazon, and I have got to tell you, This item Echo Show and Echo Plus is the best item I have ever had and I am kind of a tech geek. I am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my Nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. I wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. They are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. Although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the Echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. Thank God, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. Thank you Amazon. I will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from Affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house. Jeff Bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability I was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event. really helped when all you earn a month is $672 on SSDI thank you all again.	1
2017	The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  	0
2018	Great phone.	1
2019	The Echo Plus is used for leisure and pleasure. I absolutely love it. Easy to set up and connect. What a great addition to my listening pleasure. I have not used it yet for other purposes.	1
2020	We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.	1
2021	One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0

2032	"""Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's """"Big Stick"""".

2037	It didn't charge for me.	0
2038	This is the best Alexa enabled device you can get, it is so versatile and useful. It sound way better than the dot but not as good as the regular echo. The screen makes all the difference in the world.	1
2039	My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  	0
2040	Weak sound. Compared to the Google Home Mini the sound is bad. Also you need Prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. Also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. I think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.	0
2041	My sister has one also and she loves it.	1
2042	The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1

2054	Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.  I like being able to turn lights on and off while away from home.	1
2055	I really enjoy being able to just make a request  for my favorite music and it happens I have no complaints at this time...	1
2056	Got for elderly parents,easy for them to use.just instructions could be more informative	1

2069	I have had the echo dot for about two weeks and am having fun with it. I set morning alarms, check the weather, have Alexa play various music (I bought inexpensive speakers to connect for better sound), and I'm learning her skills. A little tricky to connect to wifi initially, but after some trial and error it connected, and has stayed connected. So far, super satisfied. Will be buying one for my mother and one for my office.	1

2100	This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  	1
2101	Love that I have command access to news such as Bloomberg TV, NPR, etc.Highly recommend that you gain access to Alexa app before setting up Device and get familiar with key features/services...such as setting up your daily commute.If family and friends have Spot...then it’s a great substitute for Skype and Face Time...you can always “drop in” when missing loved ones or just to catch up.	1
2102	Got it and, as expected, ITS GREAT! Almost a swell as my SHOW.	1
2103	But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.	1
2104	Alexa seems to get dumber and less useful all the time	1
2105	Works great, can't tell it was refurbished and set up in kids mode.  I have 3 in my home and will be adding more. I love these things.	1
2106	Love it it's number 4!	1
2107	We've owned a number of Echo devices, but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool.  Other than playing music through a sound system, we haven't found much use for them.  We just don't find the voice user interface to be all that efficient.  The Echo Spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you're routinely interested in.  Furthermore, you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings.  We now use these as bedside clocks.	1
2108	Love it, love it!!!!!!!!	1
2109	I was a little apprehensive about buying a refurbished electronic product, but with Amazon's guarantee, thought I would try it. Glad I did, and will probably buy another refurb product form Amazon. I love the Alexa products and have several. This one sits on my desk. Has a small footprint, but has great sound and I use it daily. Works great.	1

2116	Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.	0
2117	Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.	1
2118	I had strawberry tea, which was good.	1
2119	Great streaming device	1
2120	Love being able to see, as well as hear things.  Sound is better, too!	1
2121	At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
2122	Good speaker for bedroom or office	1
2123	It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.	1
2124	Got it specifically to work with the August Smart Lock and it connected to it with ease.  Definitely ties the Smart Home together.	1

2133	Having received this as a gift, I am writing my initial thoughts: (compared to my google home mini)PROS:  Way easier to setup than the google home mini.  I was able to connect ALL of my smart home device (unlike google) without any issues.  Making phone calls on this was clearer for the receiver to understand me.CONS:  Need to enable 'skills' to get more functionality.  Google home has built in functionality to search the web for answer to questions easier than  the amazon echo.  Could not connect this to youtube.	1
2134	Love my echo dot easy to use and set up	1
2135	love it as I do all of my echos	1
2136	Poor Reliability.	0
2137	Works perfectly, Alexa turns on and off my lights, my tv, roomba!	1
2138	Battery lasts only a few hours.	0
2139	When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.	0
2140	It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.	1
2141	However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.	0
2142	Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!	1
2143	Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!	1
2144	Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.	1
2145	Service sucks.	0
2146	I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  	1
2147	It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...	1
2148	I sure love Alexa!  LOL!  Thank you!  Great price and product!	1
2149	I’m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub. So bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and I was looking forward to this feature. Being able to play music, check the weather etc is fine.	0
2150	Love the Echo Show.  Being able to see the lyrics of the songs as they play or to be able to put a recipe up on the screen is wonderful!!	1
2151	Works great!	1
2152	Dont trust this....	0
2153	We like it better than Roku.  Voice commands really work.	1
2154	It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  	1
2155	Versatile and fun !!!	1
2156	Is good.	1
2157	Very impressed with look, clarity of sound and color.	1
2158	This product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable:1) There is a &#34;card&#34; on the homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- it's an ad for other Alexa services you can try. You can turn off all the other homescreen cards, but not this one.2) By default, the homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, which is incredibly annoying. There is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only &#34;cycle once&#34; instead of &#34;cycle continuously&#34;, but critically *this setting does not work*. My unit has been set to &#34;cycle once&#34;, and the cards still continue to cycle all the time. Have rebooted the device, re-set, etc etc.Until these two obvious software issues are fixed, in my opinion the product is useless.	0
2159	Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
2160	Nothing special.	0
2161	Love it!	1
2162	Some times Alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!	1
2163	I love it ita like having a personal assistant and computer and everything else in one.	1
2164	I mean this in a terrible way.  	0
2165	Easy to set up.	1
2166	Entertainment	1
2167	Excellent to listen to my music, my audio books, and look all my cameras in and around my house.	1
2168	What I really like there is the crepe station.	1
2169	I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.	1
2170	I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.	0
2171	Amazing so far. Just got it the other day.	1
2172	Nothing at all to recommend.  	0
2173	This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	0
2174	received the wrong product...was so excited to install it ...all excitement gone. Thank you Amazon.	0
2175	We like the video calling feature. We got this so we can be in contact with our elderly parents and it works well	1
2176	This device is awesome!	1
2177	I like how clear the screen is. Hi resolution	1
2178	I love having an Alexa!	1
2179	I bought this on prime day and saved lots.I have 3 large blue tooth speakers in my house that I used for years, the echo plus was louder than all 3 combined at the same time. Very impressed with the clarity and volume.You will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio. That’s just a sad fact. It’ll play pandora and Spotify but it’s limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptionDoes not stream YouTube music or YouTube audioApple users will be disappointed to see that it’s not as convenient as an apple deviceOverall, I still loved the device but I’ll be getting the DOT which has an audio out jack (as does the echo plus) and just connect to external speakers	1
2180	New device so still learning about it but works great for us when navigating Hulu.	1
2181	The firestick is easy to use and was super easy to set up.  I like the platform and feel it is better than I expected.  I was worried about it lagging but it has not at all.  I’m hoping to utilize the firestick to eventually break away from cable and now I’m more confident that it can happen.	1
2182	Need to be able to connect to more 3rd party viceo apps	0
2183	We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.	1
2184	These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.	0
2185	We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.	1
2186	Great speaker with a lot of capabilities. Very fun to learn how to use it.	1
2187	A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
2188	so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app	1
2189	Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	0
2190	Very good lunch spot.	1
2191	Makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. Great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such.	1
2192	Absolutely love it!	1
2193	I’m never disappointed with amazons technology.	1
2194	All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  	1
2195	DELICIOUS!!	1
2196	I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.	1
2197	I love it	1
2198	I love it.  You own personal secretary.	1
2199	* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!	1
2200	Alexa takes some getting used to, but the picture quality is great, the touch screen is very responsive and smooth. Speakers are better than expected as wellFour stars out of five	1
2201	The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!	1
2202	I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!	1
2203	Perfect condition!	1
2204	I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	1
2205	Weird vibe from owners.	0
2206	Their chow mein is so good!	1
2207	This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  	1
2208	The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
2209	Easy to set up and connect with smart devices. Just what I needed!	1
2210	This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  	0
2211	Customer service was terrible.	0
2212	These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.	1
2213	Works great! Looks brand new! Love my new echo dot. I will be getting them for all the main rooms in the house.	1
2214	Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube.	1
2215	Happy with this as I was with the other 2 I ordered!!	1
2216	The iGo chargers and tips are really great.	1
2217	Bought this to go in my niece's room. You can't tell it's refurbished. It looks good and works like new.	1
2218	Music	1
2219	Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better.	1
2220	On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	0
2221	This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  	0
2222	The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  	0
2223	Meh	0
2224	disappointing.	0
2225	Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.	1
2226	She doesn’t always listen	1
2227	I love the sound very good. We use it for home automation also works well!!	1
2228	Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	0
2229	We love our Echo Show!	1
2230	Cute, quaint, simple, honest.	1
2231	I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again.	0
2232	There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  	0
2233	Can't turn of &#34;things to try&#34; on the screen scroll. This  is a big promotion device for Amazon.  Packing it up and sending it back.  They really want to get in our heads.  Enough already.	0
2234	The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	1
2235	Avoid at all cost!	0
2236	It's constantly buffering, to the point where you can't watch anything without interruption. I purchased on Prime Day plus I used rewards to pay for it, so in the end I paid next to nothing. If I had paid full price for it I might want my money back. We stopped trying to use it and went back to our old streaming device. I know our internet service is not the issue because we do not have this problem with any other devices that we stream from.	0
2237	(It works!)	1
2238	Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!	0
2239	Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  	0
2240	Would recommend this item.	1
2241	If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  	0
2242	Sound is better	1
2243	Loved it!! Wish I would have bought one sooner.	1
2244	Great sound and easy to set up.	1
2245	It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.	1
2246	This product is easy to use and very entertaining.  I have yet to hook it up to my TV or lights but look forward to doing so.	1
2247	We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn’t buy two since we got it on Prime day!	1
2248	They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0
2249	It doesn't make you look cool.	0
2250	Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.	1
2251	You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.	0
2252	Works great! Perfect for my office!	1
2253	It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  	1
2254	Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  	0
2255	Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.	1
2256	This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  	1
2257	Doesn't always respond to the wake word. This is my 3rd echo product and I have to say I am A little disappointed. Alexa voice assistant is great when it comes to controlling a connected home but has a lot to learn from google assistant when it comes to  getting answers for search queries.	1
2258	Already owning a couple of Echos, I was frustrated that I couldn’t also use them as intercoms. Finally Amazon enables the “drop-in” feature so now I can use my Echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house (and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner).As for its other features, we mainly use our Echos for the standard stuff: playing music, setting alarms, answering questions, etc. It's not the life-changing home device Amazon would have you believe, but it is convenient to have around. This refurb saved me a few bucks, looks and works the same as the other brand-new ones.	1
2259	Great product. Wakes me up every morning on time!	1
2260	the phone was unusable and was not new.	0
2261	A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  	1
2262	Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.	1
2263	I think the dot listens better than spot.	1
2264	Its was easy to set up	1
2265	I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	0
2266	I am pleased with the Echo Show, from the sound of the music and the words to the tunes to the news and weather. The color on the screen for my photos could be better.	1
2267	The food was very good.	1
2268	I LOVED it!	1
2269	We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound	1
2270	this is my first Alexa enabled device and so far its lived up to its reputation!	1
2271	I like almost everything	1
2272	An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	1
2273	Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off.	1
2274	It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	0
2275	It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.	0
2276	I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  	1
2277	The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.	0
2278	Seems to be a good product but, unable to play music in sync with my Sonos system. Sonos doesn't seem to recognize it at all.	1
2279	It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  	0
2280	Listening to music, searching locations, checking time, looking up weather. There are many more task to learn. It was simple to set up.	1
2281	The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.	0
2282	Works great ..good sound	1
2283	A great replacement for the bedside alarm clock, which had a funny habit of going off at 12am every time the cleaning ladies came through. We mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off, while leaving the fan running. Only gripe would be the mic sensitivity, which doesn't appear be as good as the View or Gen2. It can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself.	1
2284	We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.	1
2285	Still learning everything she can do.  Good for a room.  Volume is pretty good without an additional speaker	1
2286	Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!	1
2287	On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.	1
2288	Great for my office. I use this daily in many ways, to include spelling for me and background music.	1
2289	Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  	1
2290	Everyone is treated equally special.	1
2291	How awesome is that.	1
2292	Bought the spot and loved it. Within months it started acting funny and would stop working—called and they determined that it was overheating. I was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. A week goes by with absolutely no response so I do the inline chat per instructions. Told to wait longer. REALLY????  Unacceptable—expected more from Amazon. Find it funny how they always thank me for being a Prime member but when an issue arises I cannot even get assistance.	0
2293	I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you	1
2294	I have an original Echo and really like it. I wanted another one for my basement. I realize it isn't a huge stereo with settings but it doesn't sound bad at all. Definitely doesn't take up much room. Great price for the Echo Plus on Prime Day. I ordered two!!	1
2295	I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call.	1
2296	I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?  	0
2297	The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	1
2298	Food arrived quickly!	1
2299	BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.	1
2300	I liked it, perfect size, the screen is really clear,  and elegant.	1
2301	Love this. So glad I purchased	1
2302	in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.	0
2303	This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  	0
2304	You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.	0
2305	Just got my third one. Love them	1
2306	Easy to use.	1
2307	We got this as a wedding gift and haven’t discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!	1
2308	Works absolutely great	1
2309	REALLY UGLY.	0
2310	Very disappointed when we had to mandatory upgrade and when we final got done with the upload, we had lost our local Charlotte NC channels (which are pur news and weather also)  (CBS, NBC, ABC) and 2 days later was Amazon day with discounts on what we had JUST ordered.	0
2311	Exactly as advertised	1
2312	They dropped more than the ball.	0
2313	It works	1
2314	The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	1
2315	Great phone.	1
2316	I'm an original purchaser of the Echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and I've always loved it. I expanded my Alexa usage by adding a few Echo Dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an Echo Plus. Let me tell you what, GREAT choice! As much as I love my original Echo, the Plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable. The sound is great. And the fact that it's got a built in hub for the Philips Hue lights is a huge plus!	1
2317	It's a great place and I highly recommend it.	1
2318	Terrible. Stopped working after one day.	0
2319	Easy to set up Ready to use in minutes.	1
2320	Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it.	0
2321	The music...the shopping list and the sound....	1
2322	Pleased with the order just what I wanted!!	1
2323	But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	0
2324	I'm addicted to this thing.	1
2325	Very pleased with this headset.	1
2326	So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.	0
2327	My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.	1
2328	Best bedside clock and assistant I have ever had.	1
2329	The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  	0
2330	The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  	0
2331	I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.	1
2332	I have recommended it to friends.  	1
2333	The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  	0
2334	Love the margaritas, too!	1
2335	I am spoiled by one downstairs...so got this one for upstairs to listen to music , etc. while I walked on the treadmill.	1
2336	Easy to set up and does everything it’s a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.	1
2337	The sound quality is not that good, especially for the price that you pay for this. I would recommend to get the Echo Dot and buy a better speaker instead. Maybe Sonos and use the Echo dot.	0
2338	Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability	1
2339	Bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn’t have a cell phone.  She loves playing music and dancing and with Amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!	1
2340	Love it. Many stations to choose from	1
2341	Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!	1
2342	Made very sturdy.	1
2343	3rd Dot. Love it!	1
2344	Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!	1
2345	Not good at all!	0
2346	After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.	0
2347	Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0
2348	I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.	1
2349	Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(	0
2350	The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	1
2351	Totally gets out sense of humour	1
2352	Bacon is hella salty.	1
2353	Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  	1
2354	This one works and was priced right.	1
2355	Great sound for the size and the prize!! And of course....Alexa!	1
2356	Simply beautiful.  	1
2357	Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it!	0
2358	Worked as advertised. Thanks	1
2359	Very disappointing.  	0
2360	Does everything I could ask and more. Great product.	1
2361	Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  	1
2362	The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.	0
2363	The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  	1
2364	It is very comfortable on the ear.	1
2365	The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.	1
2366	I’m very unhappy with this Firestick, every time we change programs or channels within a program there is a very long delay. We have 2 Roku’s That work just fine and are very quick.	0
2367	Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  	1
2368	So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	1
2369	Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	1
2370	Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.	0
2371	What can I say. Well, I’m a  paranoid IT person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control. So yes I love my echo stuff but, I did create a isolated VLAN on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app. Be carful with these people!  Entering your Wi-Fi password on a site that’s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing. Try to stay with devices that  work directly with the Alexa hub with no third-party app, Amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the  sensitive information is handled.	1
2372	See subject line.  Love it	1
2373	I like that it responds every time. It was easy to set up.  I'm still learning what I can do with it. I may like a better speaker more.	1
2374	It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it.	1
2375	I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1
2376	Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.	0
2377	Love this thing works great and kids love it to	1
2378	I would recommend this.	1

2382	Meredith M was better than all right.  	1
2383	I never thought I was going to be THAT person that is completely connected. I purchased this and another Echo product on Prime Day and fell in love.  I have one in my office and one in our kitchen.  I have already used this for morning briefings from the News while I am getting ready for the day as well as look up recipes.  The screen is big enough for me to easily read writing (this was a concern for me).  I loved this so much I purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools.  Note: I did purchase camera covers (even though there is a button to &#34;turn off the camera and microphone&#34; and it doesn't impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about, there are work around!	1
2384	You could not tell this was refurbished. Works Excellent. I would highly recommended instead of purchasing new.	1
2385	Works like a charm. Fast delivery and no problems.	1

2387	Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  	1
2388	Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well.	1
2389	I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.	1
2390	I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!	1
2391	I love the firestick ! It's easy to set up and use. It rarely stops to buffer and. It  would be a bargain at twice the price.	1
2392	Great product! Highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it, it sits much better on the desk.	1
2393	Perfect	1
2394	I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  	0
2395	Love Alexa. Love the Echo Dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom.	1
2396	Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.	0
2397	I bought this for my healing room.  I play continuous spa like music. Although Alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  I didn't know I had to buy speakers too.	1
2398	Fast to load. But keeps rebooting  in middle of shows	0
2399	Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.	1
2400	What this film lacks is a convincing script.  	0
2401	The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.	1

2410	It appears to be working fine my first Echo stopped replying to my requests and I received the Echo plus very happy no problems no hassel exchange.	1
2411	Excellent performance.  	1
2412	I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music.	1
2413	Seriously flavorful delights, folks.	1
2414	Worth every cent.	1
2415	His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	0

2422	Love it love it love it	1
2423	It talks to me, plays the type of music i want to listen to, and even turns off when I ask if to.	1
2424	I bought this for my 90 year old grandmother and she and I love it!!! She can call all her family members with just her voice, play games, even watch a video and I love that I can “drop in” on her any time to see how she is doing. She lives all by herself. And I feel comfortable if there was an emergency she could call out to Alexa for help!!	1
2425	The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker is very compound in size, however it  projects very good sound. It also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker  for greater projection of sound. I also like it size because it's not awkward, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. It works great with the Alexa App. I also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing.	1
2426	Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.	1
2427	It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	0
2428	Love all the options with the fire tv stick!Works great!	1
2429	WORKS GREAT	1
2430	Go rent it.  	1

2432	Very, very sad.	0
2433	Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  	1
2434	I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!	1

2447	The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.	1

2449	EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.	1
2450	Dislike the volume. It does not sound loud enough.	1
2451	I can receive my CPR classical station.  Great sound.What I like least is the learning curve and my mistakes.	1
2452	Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
2453	i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.	1
2454	As an echo its great, Good sound quality and functionality. As a smart home hub, it sucks. No automation, no geo-fencing, no music syncing for hue, no z-wave. All it does is turn things on with your voice. Ended up buying a smartthing hub and transferring everything over.	0
2455	If you are reading this please don't go there.	0
2456	Fairly useless.	0
2457	Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0
2458	They refuse to refund or replace.	0
2459	Love it!	1
2460	I am pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of Alexa. The unit is very responsive and can easily respond even with TV or music playing.I did pair two smart  bulbs and they go on, off and dim with ease using voice or app. Fidelity is very good for the size.My only regret is that I would have liked a silver model or a fabric cover but that is an unimportant issue.	1
2461	The ease of set up and overall functionality makes this Echo show worth every penny.  I especially like setting my background screen and being able to set affirmations that I use as personalized reminders.	1
2462	Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.	1
2463	I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.	0
2464	very handy in the kitchen, sets timer and gives me extra help on setting oven temps.	1

2467	The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	1
2468	Looks and works perfect. Glad I got a good deal.	1
2469	I love the product , but very disappointed once I  realized I can no longer play youtube videos.  I'm now past my 30 days return date.  I am realizing I now have an expensive alarm clock.  I am hoping youtube comes back.  I was looking to buy an echo show for the kitchen during prime day. Glad I didn't.	0

2490	I had some trouble with my echo dot when I first got it because of internet connection issues. After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.	1
2491	If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0
2492	Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.	1
2493	I bought this for my mother and she loves it! I want to get one for myself now!	1
2494	Honestly I like it but at the same time I don’t I could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half I bought it for the video chat and I have never really used it	0
2495	Still learning about the Echo show but so far we love it. My 9 year old loves to cook and especially with his Aunt that lives out of state and now he can connect with her and they cook together.	1
2496	His performance is simply genius.  	1
2497	The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	1
2498	Bought a refurb, and its works just as my new ones I bought prior! Came in original packaging as well!	1
2499	Super-Easy setup, only issue i find is that it occasionally loses connection with household network.	1
2500	i had a couple of echo dots previously - bought these _SPECIFICALLY_ for the Ring doorbell video / cloud cam display / interface capabilities. WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. Love the fact that I can ask to see front yard / back yard / front door, etc.the video chat with the other rooms is also quite cool.BONUS: “Alexa show me Ant Man trailer, etc”i know this can all be done on laptop/desktop, but it’s cool now having an ‘appliance’ that’s always just there, and it doesn’t interrupt what i’m doing.	1
2501	It works perfect!	1
2502	Workreat	1
2503	Super fun !! I ty is what I was expecting	1

2510	Looked Brand new works great. I love these echo dots and the refurbished ones are like new	1
2511	To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  	0
2512	I use the echo dot several different ways in my home. I use it downstairs to control lighting. I also take it out on my deck to stream music to a Bluetooth speaker. It works great for what I need.	1
2513	Love it. Works great making my home a smarthome	1

2517	Small size works great in our sunroom.	1
2518	The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  	1
2519	Alexa is awesome! The first day I got my Echo Plus I found out things that she can do that I didn’t think were even possible. I highly recommend this product. Along with all the accessories.	1
2520	Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  	0
2521	Cumbersome design.	0
2522	Returned from repair with No repair done. It has a problem which requires it to be on for a while for the defective part to show itself.I sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed.  The site gives no option to complain from the page.I have a echo spot which works perfectly in the same position.	0
2523	Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  	0
2524	Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  	1

2533	A small problem out of the box, but a rep from Amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues. I was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!? (lol)I think GF is worried that if Alexa learns to cook, her time will be limited...	1
2534	I have had pure fun with my echo.  Weather, jokes, news briefing, and music but still so much more to use it for.  A lot of fun for the money.	1
2535	Perfect for controlling my tp-link smart devises	1
2536	Works as expected. This is our fourth one, our son loves it in his room. Easy to set an alarm and he can play music through it.	1

2550	When I got this Echo I was excited to have a device with better sound than my Dot and a hub to control some Hue bulbs.What I didn't realize and also wasn't fully communicated to me, is that you can't use Hue bulbs to their full potential with this device. You can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors. You also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.Do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new IoT devices. If you do, you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub, which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless.I still love the echo and have zero complaints about the Alexa functionality or sound quality of this device. I'm only disappointed with the hub's functionalities.	0
2551	better sound than my echo dot. Simple to set up, less than 5 minutes.	1

2568	4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.	1
2569	I am also very happy with the price.	1
2570	I like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn't wireless and the volume is not that high.	1

2586	I don't know why I like it, but I do. It's like an all-in-one alarm clock.  If you have other alexa devices, you know what it is.  If you are looking to get an alarm clock, this is the one to get (yes, its much more than that).  It shows you the time, it shows you the weather, its touch screen, it shows you music lyrics, and it does all the things your typical alexa device does.  It's quite loud for its size as well (sound way better than echo dot).  It also does video calling, which is pretty awesome.  The viewing angle is great, so even if its sitting fairly high up, you can still see the display well enough.	1
2587	bought for my wife she loves it	1
2588	He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.	1
2589	Easy setup. Was up and running in minutes. The learning feature is outstanding. Now I know why Amazon is so far ahead of the competition.	1

2609	Sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it doesn’t respond or you forget the correct command.  “Alexa, turn on the living room lights”.  Oops I mean “Alexa turn on the family room lights”. I also never realized I call my couch a sofa some times.  Unfortunately my Alexa is confused by my changing names for where I sit.	1
2610	Mainly use it for the music but I’m learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it	1

This is a huge drawback and why The echo show dropped in price.  International radio via tune in is awesome but again her search engine, its like pulling teeth to get to anything.	1

2623	It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	1
2624	Great sound and easy to set up.	1
2625	The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  	0
2626	A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.	1
2627	I purchased the Amazon Echo Plus on Amazon prime day because I need a hub. I'm in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home. For the same price as some hub's, and even less expensive in some other cases. I got a hub that works with my devices, plus it does a lot more. I haven't even had time to go through all the skills it has, but I've already found myself using many of them. When I started a search for a hub. I wasn't even considering the Echo. In part, because I didn't know it was a hub. But also because I didn't really think I would find much use for another AI system. If you're looking for a hub. Why settle for a plane hub, when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost's the same or less than other hubs? Oh! And by the way. For the same price as the Amazon Echo Plus alone. I found one that came bundled with a smart bulb & saw another that came with a smart plug. Given the price of these extras. Well, that just put the Echo Plus over the top.	1
2628	Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music.	1
2629	;) Recommend with confidence!  	1
2630	I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.	1
2631	It still doesn’t work.  I bet if I call and let them know that, they will charge me for the 3rd time.  Ridiculous.	0
2632	I have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. It was even easier to set up than my original echo.	1
2633	The service was terrible though.	0
2634	Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1
2635	Good speaker for bedroom or office	1
2636	Excellent why didn’t I think it is in the beginning I love it	1
2637	Love my Echo Spot!	1
2638	Ease of use!	1
2639	Also the story and acting were weak.  	0
2640	Easy to hook up.  Wish I knew all its capabilities	1
2641	It's pretty fun and nice to have a speaker that responds to my questions but doesn't understand my commands some of the time.	1
2642	Great case and price!	1
2643	All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  	0
2644	It is much more difficult to use than the Chromecast.	0
2645	The Fire TV Stick was easy to set up and use. Only downfall is, subscriptions are needed to view premium content.	1
2646	Ample portions and good prices.	1
2647	"""I also didn't like the """"on"""" button, it felt like it would crack with use."""	0
2648	Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.	1
2649	Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).	1
2650	I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!	1
2651	The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  	0
2652	By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  	0
2653	It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.	1
2654	I've had an Alexa Dot for some time but I'm really enjoying the Alexa Show. It's great to have a visual whether it's a song or the weather. Played Jeapordy, but I'm not good at it. You do learn trivia and no one's watching! Love that recipes are visible and movies are available. Haven't had it long enough to try everything.	1
2655	Filmiing was less expansive.  	0
2656	It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  	1
2657	I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  	0
2658	Very easy to hook up. Download the app and it walks you through the setup	1
2659	The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  	1
2660	I like it and still learning how to use it.	1
2661	And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	0
2662	wonderful product and fast delivery!	1
2663	I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.	1
2664	Incredible!.	1
2665	Speakers are not as loud as Google Home	1
2666	I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.	1
2667	I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.	1
2668	Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0

2670	You wont regret it!  	1
2671	And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  	0
2672	They have great dinners.	1
2673	Food was really good and I got full petty fast.	1
2674	I bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and I was excited when it came in the next day. I set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine. The set up was easy and straight forward which I really appreciated because I am terrible with technology. The only reason why I am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that I can't use the Echo Dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet. I am connected to both 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ wifi links and neither works. It's very frustrating because I am not getting my use out of the Echo Dot and I really wish I could. If any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know!	1
2675	Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0
2676	The product is attractive and somewhat useful, BUT, Amazon chose to force users to view their “things to try” and Trending”.  This greatly depreciates the value of the product.  Do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from Amazon.	0
2677	Love it!	1
2678	A+	1
2679	Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.	0
2680	I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.	1
2681	I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.	0
2682	Totally clear picture with numerous channels available. Used for my kitchen tv	1
2683	This is the best Amazon speaker with Alexa in it.  But if you’re thinking it’s a good smart hub you’re wrong. Are you can do is connect your smart lights and devices to it and tell Alexa to Turn them on and off. That’s it! You’re better off buying separate hubs so you have more control of your devices.	1
2684	And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0
2685	This was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. He loves it, ask Alexa anything she has the answer, plus it’s good for homework. So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I’m getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it’s metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock..	1
2686	I do like the Fire Stick and I’m very close to cutting the cable.  I can find many movies and shows, while keeping my budget in check.  I’m learning how to maneuver around the channels and find my shows quickly.	1
2687	Fast shipping and works well	1
2688	Easy to set up.	1
2689	No problems, works as expected. Could have a better speaker.	1
2690	The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0
2691	Nice toy to have around!	1
2692	I love this device! All the functionality of an Amazon Echo with the added benefit of a video screen. It looks great on my nightstand as a clock (lots of faces to choose from) and displays weather, reminders, etc. I think it can do video calls too but I use FaceTime for that anyway. It’s a great shape and doesn’t take up a lot of room. I’m planning to get another one for my guest room. Awesome for a great price!	1
2693	So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  	0
2694	Very wind-resistant.	1

2710	As you can see Echo Show is in kitchen. It far exceeds my expectation. There’s a wealth of information about any topic. If is customizable for sound and video. I also have Echo and Echo Dot. You can group them and have hole house music. Still not done exploring all it can do love it. Perfect for getting recipes so you can see them while you’re preparing to cook.	1

2724	I love having an Alexa!	1
2725	Works beautifully, excellent sound.	1
2726	Cool little piece of tech...we’re still learning some of its functions and possibilities, but I can see some potential.  Even my ‘technically challenged’ wife already figured out how to video call our daughter.	1
2727	I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!	1
2728	I own 3 of these...  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool.  You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, Things to Try...  People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.Moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker.  That would give you a 5 star device.Right now i’m debating whether to return all 3 devices.  My wife says we should.	0
2729	I have 2 of them the one I have to reset it at least once a week or so some times twice	1
2730	Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.	1
2731	We put one in the bedroom.  It plays music and tells us the weather.  It also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  It is better than a clock radio.  It will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  It can even tell jokes.  I don't know how I got along without it before now.  Amazing.	1
2732	We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
2733	It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  	1
2734	I like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.	1
2735	This was a replacement of an older version of Fire Stick. I haven't tried the Alexa voice part of this remote yet, but it works great.	1
2736	Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	1

2774	Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  	0
2775	But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  	0
2776	The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.	1

2798	We got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired ! it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once I did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff ! it should do Text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others !the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the Web by voice so he wouldn't feel left out and isolated ! they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the Echo so tech support can help setup the device ! I had to get a friend whos an IT guy to come help me setup	1

I also bought a 4k fire TV and it can open Amazon prime video or Netflix at any moment. The included hue lighting makes this product even better. I found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room. The addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer. Alexa will controll it all as soon as you say """"Hey Alexa"""". And if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device. This is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort."""	1
2802	Fun to play with	1
2803	Purchased this on Prime Day and I absolutely love it!  I had the Echo Dot on my nightstand, but I really missed a display. This is perfect and the speakers are excellent.	1
2804	It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.	0
2805	It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it.	1

2814	Always wanted one,till I got one, it's not at all what it's cracked up to be, it's hard to navigate I actually like the dot better.	0
2815	Cant say enough good things about this place.	1
2816	I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.	1
2817	Bye bye Philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge!  Took a little tinkering, had to rest the individual bulbs, but works great! No more, &#34;Philips hue bridge is not responding&#34; message.	1
2818	Unit is working great, but it is a true PIA that products today are shipped without user manuals. Do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased? I have no idea of the echo show's capabilities. I have it linked to my Hue lights, but have no idea what commands will work, and what won't. I purchased a Fire TV Stick along with the Show, but have no idea how to maximize the two. Just a few examples.I even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful. Seems way too basic to me, but better than a kick in the pants.	1

2833	Cord cutting	1
2834	Works exactly how you would expect, right out of the box. I love being able to not only hear, but now see, what I need on this device. I loved my regular echo, but the Show is just so much better!  It works wonderfully for music (especially paired with the Amazon music account) and is perfect with my ring doorbell. Love it!	1
2835	is pretty funny.  	1
2836	I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;.

2846	The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.	1
2847	Bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn’t have a cell phone.  She loves playing music and dancing and with Amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!	1
2848	As a user of Chromecast for years I have to say that the Firestick is a nice upgrade. I really like that I can download all the apps for different media sources like HBO, Showtime, etc. that I have free access to from my cable account but with the Firestick I get a better picture and can go directly to the shows I want to see. The downside was the time it took to download all the apps and set them up, but the good thing is that the setup is a onetime procedure.	1
2849	I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.	1
2850	Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  	1
2851	It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!	1

2858	He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  	0
2859	Had a little trouble at the beginning until I replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times Alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees!  Like when it was 91 degrees, Alexa would say it was 81 degrees.  Otherwise, everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from Amazon and my Pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist.	1

2894	This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
2895	I don’t like that it goes into sleep mode after 20-30 minutes of “inactivity”. I shouldn’t have to “wake up” the fire tv to finish watching a show.	0

2906	Great improvement over the original Echo.  Like the ability to see lyrics to songs, watch Prime TV and get other visuals.  The little hints about things to try that appears across the bottom sparks the imagination.	1

2920	Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.	1
2921	It isn’t bad for what it is. Have issues with it actually playing what I want. Getting it use iHeartRadio properly by playing the station I want is a challenge but it’s not bad for the sale price I paid.	1
2922	No problems whatsoever makes life easy and sounds great.	1
2923	I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven't decided if I'll keep it or not!	1

2937	Very easy to install. Voice control is great.	1
2938	Works awesome!	1
2939	Not happy with the Spot.  Reset numerous times.  Seems to be in slow mode.  Have to be practically on top of it for it to hear me.  Even after talking with support I still do not have “themes” in the menu to choose from!	0
2940	Even worse than Ticker!  	0
2941	Works as advertised! It says Alexa is always learning. That's great because I am just learning all the things Alexa can do.	1
2942	We have so much fun with this!  So easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to Alexa!!	1
2943	I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!	1
2944	It worked as a charmed.	1
2945	Love it -- the best.  My experience with refurbished devices is excellent.	1

2947	Awesome! Easy set up. Linked right up with my Nexia home automation.	1
2948	Outstanding product - easy to use.  works great	1
2949	Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.	1
2950	We have six of these throughout our home and they are great.  There are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening.  There should be more options to change the name of the engagement command &#34;Alexa&#34; or &#34;Computer&#34; are a little annoying.  More colors then black and white would also be a good thing.	1
2951	😍	1
2952	I love my echo dot. Has many features and works great.The only thing I don't like about it, is that I can't play my iMusic on it. I'm going to have to pay for a Spotify or Amazon music account.	1
2953	I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product.	1
2954	more compact and a bit better than the original	1
2955	I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  	0

2969	The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.	1
2970	very nice and its does not take up space	1
2971	This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.	1
2972	There was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep I spoke with could fix. The replacement was registered to someone else. When the price of the Dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones), I bought a brand, spanking new one. No problem with the new one.	0
2973	Love it	1

2983	We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0
2984	Nice picture good sound but the mics are not as sensitive as a dot, my dots can hear me from across the house the Show does not, that being said I LOVE the show!!I can watch TV and movies while in tg ed kitchen, have the News playing or Music....love....it !!	1
2985	we like it. very convenient	1

2996	This is a great product!  Set up was easy.  Sound is wonderful.	1
2997	it's great for music, a little hard to figure out how it works.	1
2998	After two weeks I am not sure if I like the ever present Alexa to have a screen as well.  I bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  There is something about only audio that made Alexa different, no I some ways it is a TV that you can talk to.	1
2999	Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.	0
3000	Love it. I play music everyday and voice  activated makes it so easy	1
3001	Fun To interact with	1
3002	In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
3003	Awesome	1
3004	The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0
3005	It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...	1
3006	This is the best of my echo devices and I own a spot a dot and echo	1
3007	"""But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as """"pretentious crap"""".  """	0
3008	I enjoy seeing lyrics on the screen for different Amazon music stations	1
3009	Loving this way more than google home devices. I've been using for a couple months and if you're an amazon prime subscriber the value here is greater than google. I'm using to listen to free music with prime (better than alternatives), audible and you can even watch movies. The display is a little small for lots of watching, the sound should be louder, and YOUTUBE NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE. These issues put this at a 3.5 to 4 stars. Fix one of them (youtube) and its a 5 star item. To alleviate sound I've paired with a blue tooth speaker. Right now this sits in my living area. Where I think it will shine is my office desk. Once there are great offers I could see purchasing additional for nightstand or other Amazon Alexa items for my household. I felt happy after adding this to my house where as I felt stupid using google home.	1
3010	But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	0
3011	Love the echo dot it’s amaxing!!!	1
3012	Good Service-check!	1
3013	Works great!.	1

3015	I have 2 Echos, one I bought brand new and the other is a refurbished one.Honestly, I can't tell the difference in performance and looks.	1
3016	Just like it's big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room.	1
3017	I'll even say it again  this is torture.  	0
3018	Product is exactly as described.	1
3019	This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.	0
3020	You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  	1
3021	It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	1
3022	But now I was completely grossed out.	0
3023	great price great product fire stick is the best i think works better then roku.	1
3024	Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.	1
3025	With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  	0
3026	Absolutely love it! I use it for everything!I tell my friends and clients that it’s the daughter I never had. I ask her to do something and she doesn’t complain! I wish I bought the 2package deal :( I truly needed one in my work room. I kick myself for it.	1
3027	Love it! Very helpful	1
3028	Love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps	1
3029	Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much 😁😁😁😁	1
3030	Like the little spot,  now our guest room is Alexa enabled.	1
3031	It is a really good show to watch.  	1
3032	We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound	1
3033	Surprisingly good beefy sound out of this thing. I think it might shape up to be one of my favorite echo devices. I have nearly all of them. ;-)	1
3034	Wow... Loved this place.	1
3035	absolutely an amazing device, very easy to setup and use	1
3036	As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.	0
3037	these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs.	1
3038	love Alexa, makes it fun when people are around and seeing it for first time	1
3039	Overall, a great experience.	1
3040	It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.	1
3041	I bought 2 of these (plus 2 Echo Dot 2nd Generation) on Prime Days. Love the Echo Plus easy to setup. The reason for the 4 star is the fact that one of them did not arrive with the free Philips Hue White A19 Single LED Bulb Works with Amazon Alexa. There is no one to call to find out why.	1
3042	too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	0
3043	I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!	0
3044	Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0

3046	Works like a charm.	1
3047	Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.	0
3048	I consider this theft.	0
3049	Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0
3050	I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.	0
3051	This is a great product!  Set up was easy.  Sound is wonderful.	1
3052	Works great in my large open room	1
3053	Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	1
3054	The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  	0
3055	I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!	1
3056	The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.	0
3057	I love Alexa, she works great but she not for little children. She doesn't understand if you don't speak clearly. She fun to have	1
3058	I highly recommend this device to everyone!	1
3059	It won’t work as a blue tooth speaker with my tv,it connects but won’t work	1
3060	Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.	0
3061	PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  	1
3062	I’ve had this for a little over 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it! It’s so easy to use. I’m basically using it as a smart alarm but it can do way more. The screen quality is great and it looks super cute sitting on my night stand. I don’t know how I lived without it so long. If you can’t decide whether to buy it or not, GO FOR IT! You won’t regret it!!	1
3063	LOVE MY ECHO SHOW.  Everything about this device is wonderful	1
3064	Purchased for grandson.	1
3065	My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities	1
3066	Love it...so happy to have everything available through this	1
3067	& That movie was bad.  	0
3068	So far using it for lights and music. Will connect my tv, vacuum and doorbell soon. Love it!!!!	1
3069	Great device.  Seems to work better than the 1st generation!	1
3070	If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
3071	The setup of this device was simple and effective.  I am very pleased to see all of the additional skills and add on abilities of Alexa.  This is great for my mobility issues.  I now have the ability to have my shopping and comfort needs met without depending on friends and family.	1
3072	Great gadget that installs, and works easily. Nice to not have another box taking up space too!	1
3073	Love it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo. It is awesome have used it for everything my lights since I work nights and shopping as well as for my spotify. And planning on getting it for my parents to help them out for everyday things we take for granted when we are young... I would recommend this to everyone!!!!	1
3074	works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.	1
3075	This is a great phone!.	1
3076	Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.	1
3077	The ease to use product	1
3078	A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	1
3079	Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!	1
3080	I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	0
3081	Loved it till someone stoled it. Can't afford to replace it yet but I am going too.	1
3082	Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.	1
3083	Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  	1
3084	Went for lunch - service was slow.	0
3085	It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  	0
3086	I enjoy this little thing a lot.  Will do almost anything.  I like the jokes it tells.  I’m still learning different functions	1
3087	The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  	0
3088	The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1
3089	I like the interaction of asking questions. I don’t like that I can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.	1
3090	So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.	0
3091	We enjoy it	1
3092	I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.	1
3093	Great addition to my Echo Plus!	1
3094	Good value, great food, great service.	1
3095	Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.	0
3096	Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices.	1
3097	I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
3098	Good smart home gadget.	1
3099	Much easier to use than the dot. It picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding The screen is a nice perk but I only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed, the screen is too small to watch shows..It displays my alarm in print so I know Alexa heard me correctly. and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures.  My only complaint is that they don't add the stand as standard. I didn't need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed.Many people complain about the basic Alexa program but it is still such new tech that I'm not going to split hairs.  The echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot.  Alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly. Now Alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice. I think Amazon is working overtime on this project. I gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything.I am so used to my Alexa that I talk to her even when I'm staying in a hotel and she's no where to be found.  Alexa, what time is it?  ALEXA???!!	1
3100	Love that is can do so much! It sits on my nightstand! Only improvements I would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger. But overall I’m happy I have it! Would recommend!	1
3101	I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good.	1
3102	Works great, some of the apps will start buffering but it’s probably my internet. Love the Alexa voice control.	1

3110	LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE. The only think I notice is that it doesn't pick-up my voice and commands as well as my Echo and Echo Dots (we have 4 Echo products throughout our house). I have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock. I'm no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists!!!!	1
3111	Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  	1
3112	All is fine with the Spot exact for one massive failing.  In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  This may be the biggest product design screw up Amazon has ever made.	0
3113	I have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a Philip Hue bulb.  The excited ended quickly.  I spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my Alexa Echo Plus.  Everything I tried, ended in a Discovery Failed message.  I tried to set this up over and over and over again.  I watched YouTube videos.  I read set up websites.  I was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon to get the tech support.  I was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  Well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  This product has tested my patience.  So far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.The only reason I gave this two stars is because Amazon will be sending me a different Echo Plus and light bulb.  The problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, I purchased another bulb and still Alexa couldn't locate this device.I pray the next attempt is successful and then I will revise this rating, but what are the odds that I was shipped a defective Echo?  The support person had the same thought.  Maybe I should be exploring the Google device but I can't get over the look of that hub.  It looks like a defuser.I can't believe I didn't find YouTube videos that show the problems I did.  Everything looked simple and seamless...NOT the experience I had.  OK, I'm done with this review because I spend enough wasted time this weekend already.	0

3125	I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don’t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try “dropping in”.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him.	1

3177	I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone’s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me.	1
3178	Pretty cool I would say.	1
3179	The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	1
3180	This is an extraordinary film.  	1

3182	Con: spotty service.	0
3183	It has a screen, microphones, speaker, and alexa lives inside.  Yup it is an Echo Show.  Expectations met.	1
3184	I love this little Spot more than I thought I would. The sound is great for such a little thing...my music plays nice and loud and clear. The video is terrific...I was watching some Prime shows just for the heck of it, and I was really impressed. Immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday!Only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars...I really wish it was cordless. I love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain. And it won’t connect to my Bluetooth speaker while playing Amazon Prime Music for some reason, which is a drag when I want to hear it in the dining room during dinner. Of course, if it was CORDLESS I could just bring it with me...otherwise, I absolutely love it and will probably buy another one!	1
3185	This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1

3192	Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet.	1

3209	Such a fun, easy, and convenient device to have around the house. No need to pick up my phone to look something up, just a few words and the world is at your fingertips. The speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp. The price is right for a device like this.	1
3210	I bought and love them. Alexa is very convenient.	1
3211	It's easy to set up and use. There are new features and skills added all the time.	1
3212	We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.	1
3213	I love my echo dot. Has many features and works great.The only thing I don't like about it, is that I can't play my iMusic on it. I'm going to have to pay for a Spotify or Amazon music account.	1
3214	Hands free calling in the house. I misplace my cell phone all the time so this is a real blessing. Really enjoying the streaming music.	1

3228	Great product and I would give 5 stars - but you can't scroll face cards without having the stupid &#34;try and ask Alexa&#34; suggestions pop up.  Yes you can have it scroll once, and just stay on the clock, but I like having other cards as well. God its the worst and SO irritating.  I got it super cheap, so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a Dot instead of a Spot.  What a dumb move on Amazons​ part.	0
3229	Love it , this time it's a gift  for friend	1
3230	I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, i control the lights and play games like categories. Has nice sound when playing music as well.	1
3231	I've had previous experience with the echo Dot and this just blows all previous expectations out of the water!It's great since it can play videos and music from multiple sources and the speakers are pretty loud.	1
3232	A truly, truly bad film.  	0
3233	so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity	1

3235	Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  	1
3236	I love this thing! The Alexa feature makes it so easy to find what you want no matter which streaming service has it.  No more searching Netflix then Amazon etc to see if either has your show,  Alexa finds it for you!	1

3278	I bought this product hoping that Alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. I would give it zero stars if I could.	0

3299	This device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock. I love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room. Its the first nightstand clock I have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep. The screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all.Overall a great addition to my smart home. Its nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn on/off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone. I have a bunch of other Alexa devices, but this was the first one with a screen.	1

3312	I especially love the long battery life.	1
3313	3rd Dot. Love it!	1
3314	Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1
3315	Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  	0
3316	The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.	1
3317	The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.	0
3318	This movie is so awesome!  	1
3319	Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  	1
3320	I like the Echo Spot because it fits into my decor and I can also sing along with my favorite songs	1
3321	Very easy to use.	1
3322	So far so good.  Neat to have a visual version of alexa's responses. Nice to see the lyrics of music you are listening to.  Flash briefings have good videos.  Speaker is much better than a dot but not the highest quality	1
3323	It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.	0
3324	I love this device. Makes life easier the more you figure out it can do.	1
3325	Then, there's the plot holes.  	0
3326	Tons of features and skills, and a very good speaker with plenty of bass for music. You still need some work on the AI, in responding to random questions though. My Android phone is far better at those... with the Echo I still get a lot of &#34;hmm, I'm not sure&#34; or &#34;I don't have an opinion on that.&#34;	1
3327	Great and easy to use	1
3328	"""Overall love it. There are just some commands which aren't effective. It may be part user error or """"Alexa"""" becoming accustom to what is being asked."""	1
3329	Small speaker tin sound. Great with good Bluetooth speaker.	1
3330	Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.	0
3331	I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  	1
3332	This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.	0
3333	Works perfect no wear and tear on the device I love Alexa working on making my home smart 😂	1
3334	Someone shouldve invented this sooner.	1
3335	Great	1
3336	Gift for husband.  Great!	1
3337	Really cool device that does a ton of stuff. Fun games like Jeopardy. We used this to set up smart bulbs and light switches. Make sure you ge the stuff that corresponds with this particular hub. Had to make a few runs back to the store for exchanges.	1
3338	A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	0
3339	I love it.  I made a group with my echo dot so I get music through my home.  I am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully I can get another spot for my bedroom..  I love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice..	1
3340	We originally got the Show to video chat family members, and it works great for that. We have found that we really like checking things hands-free like the weather and recipes. So far we have really liked the Show, and would recommend it!	1
3341	I love this technology. I'm older, but this is so easy to set up and use. I have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything I use my echo for which is in the living room.	1
3342	Their steaks are 100% recommended!	1
3343	We would recommend these to others.	1
3344	I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.	1
3345	Love the echo dot it’s amaxing!!!	1
3346	You're going to have to shell out an extra $20 bucks for the stand that should come with it so you can angle it best for how ever you are using this. My biggest gripe. I already spent an arm and a leg on this it should come with the stand.	1
3347	Get rid of the &#34;Thongs To Try&#34; screen!!!!!!!!!! Numb nuts!!!!!	0
3348	The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.	1
3349	The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  	0
3350	Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.	1
3351	Best streaming device on the market. I now own 3.	1
3352	The Alexa program is great, but the quality is not the best. It could definitely be louder.	1
3353	Easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  The sound quality while for listening to music on Pandora is wonderful!!	1
3354	"""I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained """"movie business"""" of Québec.  """	0
3355	The food was terrible.	0
3356	The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.	0
3357	Everything was good and tasty!	1
3358	Love that you can use your cell phone to call Echo or Dot. You can also use Echo and Dot as intercoms.	1
3359	Awful.  	0
3360	It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	0
3361	Service is also cute.	1
3362	They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.	1
3363	Love the product idea. Super easy to set up & get started, a breeze to do routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items to shopping/to do lists, play music, get news, just about anything it's supposed to do). The sound is good where Imhave it sitting, not tinny at all as some have found. There is one thing I HATE & it would keep me from recommending it to anyone - you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask Alexa. Unless you have her turn off the screen totally which I do when I go to bed. And it's too bad bc it's like a continuously running advertisement or set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show was on sale prior to Prime day for less than the Echo, so I figured I was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with. Because of the ever present script it's not a nice device to look at, I would not buy it again, or recommend - go with the Echo. I may still exchange the product.	1
3364	Excellent. Bought another one yesterday!	1
3365	"""Love it except that Amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual. I don't have hours to research websites. Plus, more instruction from Alexa on skills would be great. We often get the answer, """"I don't know that skill"""" even though I've added it in the app. I.e. Kwikset or Pizza Hut."""	1
3366	I like that it's smaller, but it has never understood commands as easily as our first-gen original Echo did.	1
3367	great product, but useless overall. Too many unnecessary features. Unless you have a smart home you don't need it	0
3368	I think not again	0
3369	The speaker could be better...	1
3370	"""I'm so happy to be here!!!"""""""	1
3371	I'm a bit disappointed.	0
3372	Great phone!.	1
3373	Got this in a pretty good deal during the prime day event. It sounds pretty good and works well so far.	1
3374	Works very well for Amazon and Netflix but will not a let all viewing platforms like VUDU. It also will shut down if HULU is played for more than a couple minutes and yes I have it directly plugged into the wall so low power source is not an issue (even checked outlet voltage) an issue which is typically the answer you get for that issue.over all the quality of the picture is quiet well and is a user friendly platform to use If they would fix those two issues I would have one on every tv in the house but as it sits this will be our only one. to bad to because I relay like amazon products and having Alexa is always nice	1
3375	Echo is my teacher English, he is very funny,but sometimes he does not listen to what is said.	1
3376	This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!	0
3377	This is not movie-making.  	0
3378	I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.	0
3379	Music, weather, time.	1
3380	Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!	1
3381	Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0
3382	The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!	1
3383	I have the echo but got 2 show. 1 for my Daughter. Absolutely love it. Especially for the video chat.	1
3384	camera color balance is AWFUL.	0
3385	Love it!	1
3386	Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.	1
3387	DELETE this film from your mind!  	0
3388	Very useful	1
3389	NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(	0
3390	This product is amazing! I love it!!! Best Buy!!! Only thing missing is Bluetooth	1
3391	I use this Echo to listen to music as well as a sort-of research tool. It can answer a variety of questions. I would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder, but I can't complain.I also believe it should have an internal power source. In order to use the Echo, it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord. It would be nice to use the Echo Dot on the go without having to buy the other product.	1
3392	We are still in the discovery phase, but so far we are enjoying the smart home features we have installed.	1
3393	The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1
3394	Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.	1
3395	Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.	1
3396	The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  	1
3397	Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	1
3398	Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.	1
3399	Great software for Motorolas.	1
3400	So far I like it.  I bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good.	1
3401	I love this place.	1
3402	It works	1
3403	I connected it to my whole home sound system to play prime music which my Google Home mini can't do.  It works well.	1
3404	Alarm and music, information the weather	1

3414	Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0
3415	And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	0
3416	of course!	1
3417	If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
3418	You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	0
3419	A great touch.	1
3420	It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  	1

3430	It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  	0
3431	Everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
3432	Everything was fresh and delicious!	1
3433	All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
3434	I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title.	1

3439	All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	1

3447	I love this thing.  I enjoy watching the daily news, play music with lyrics (most songs), ordering my coffee..etc	1
3448	I love the Echo Plus mainly because I don't have to worry about putting a CD, in to play. I just command a song and it plays. However; I was disappointed to learn later that it needed to stay plugged in unlike the Echo. After consulting with Amazon and learning that I can purchase a portable Echo charging station I'm good.Sincerely,	1
3449	Best headset ever!!!.	1

3461	A GREAT PRODUCT...once we learned how to work it...this thing is awesome!!!	1
3462	It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  	1
3463	Great addition to my Alexa base. Using it in my guest bedroom for music, clock and info.Dot speaker is not as strong as the base but it's a great value	1
3464	Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.	1

3470	This game rocks.  	1
3471	I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.	1
3472	I keep watching it over and over.  	1
3473	Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs	1
3474	I will be back many times soon.	1
3475	Waste of money.	0
3476	This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  	0

3478	Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.	1

3480	This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.	0
3481	My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	1
3482	This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.	1
3483	Still need more AI built into it to interact better. It needs to continue the conversation sometimes if the finding / answer needs to be right. You can't keep stop Alexa and ask again and again. Also, it should be able to access the wikipedia, dictionary in many areas with better and fast access.Needs to hear us better. Also, we should be able to name it on our own instead calling Alexa or Echo. Price can be reduced a bit (value based) and updates should be auto and daily to improve it.  Connectivity to other home equipment can be imrproved as well.Good product with good sound quality, but needs more AI built in.	1
3484	I love it	1
3485	An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  	1

3515	It Was So Cool.  	1
3516	I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	1
3517	Those phones are working just fine now.	1
3518	After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.	0
3519	The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  	0

3529	This worked well for about 6 months but then stopped connecting to the internet (wifi) and none of the trouble shooting efforts worked.  Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace.	0
3530	This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.	0
3531	The dialogue is atrocious.  	0
3532	The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  	1
3533	the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  	0
3534	Never again will I be dining at this place!	0
3535	This device works perfectly and was a good price.  We love Alexa and are having great fun with her.  The music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our morning traffic report.  I didn’t think I would enjoy having AI in the house, but it is fun, educational and entertaining even for people who aren’t tech savvy.	1
3536	Totally gets out sense of humour	1
3537	works good, ni issues	1
3538	The shrimp tender and moist.	1

3565	The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  	1
3566	Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  	1
3567	Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1
3568	Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1
3569	I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	0
3570	These are great. I bought one and then bought another right away. Grab a few of these and a few smart switched and you're set with smart home capabilities for under $150. Highly recommended.	1

3578	Good	1
3579	Works great! Perfect for my office!	1
3580	I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.	0
3581	Would be 5 stars if you could turn off the &#34;Things to Try&#34; screen!!!  I should have read up on this before buying the Spot.  Amazon, please update to enable us to turn this off!  It is SO extremely annoying to look over to see the time but instead see &#34;Things to try&#34;.	1
3582	Love my new Alexa. She works great so far.	1
3583	I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!	1

3594	Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  	1

3600	Easy to set up and does everything it’s a poster. Despite its small size the speakers are adequate. Understands instructions from across the room. Very happy with the purchase.	1

3605	I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.	1
3606	I haven't figured out how to make or receive calls.  Device tells me I need to register and I do not know what to do.	0
3607	Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.	1
3608	Overall it works very well. Some connectivity issues but it was definitely worth the money!	1
3609	Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  	1
3610	Part of it is my fault, I thought it could be wireless.  Though for the price, I still feel like it should be. Also the sound quality and volume could be better. I prefer the tap. Unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones, computers or iPads. Just not worth it.	1
3611	It works OK. This speaker quality is not much better than my iPhone X. I would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.	1
3612	Works very well, but the microphone don&#34;t pick up as well as the full size echo.  Audio quality is okay for the size.	1
3613	Great price also!	1
3614	Avoid at any and all costs.  	0
3615	The phone loads super!	1
3616	This is my second Echo, I have the Dot but the speaker is weak so I purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great.	1

3624	The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything.	1
3625	The echo plus is very straight forward and easy to use.  It plays great sounding music and can do lots of other things.  Still learning what all it can do.  Working very well so far.	1
3626	Excellent purchase!!	1
3627	Not that much different than the one we had.  Alexa is still stubborn. LOL.  We ordered it on the Prime day to get the light bulbs with it i the deal but did not get the light bulbs.  When we called she said they were sold out.  Felt bad about that.  Now we have to buy light bulbs.	1
3628	This is my second Firestick, I a very pleased with the ease of use.	1
3629	Have these in almost every room. I really have enjoyed them. Works perfectly.	1
3630	Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.	1
3631	The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.	1
3632	I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  	1

3644	And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  	0
3645	This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.	1
3646	When you think about it this really doesn’t do much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally it was able to hook up to thermostat. I can see why price is dropping like a rock.	0
3647	This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	1
3648	Really like it. The screen is a major plus.	1
3649	I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  	0
3650	Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  	1

3658	Thank God, and alarm clock with an lcd that gets dim enough for me to sleep. I'm a very light sensitive sleeper and wind up taping black tape over all my other stuff in my bed room. Not this guy. The Alexa features are nice and listening to music at night is great. We enjoy falling asleep to meditation podcasts though we have to use the skill anypod to get the podcasts we like. Video is kinda tiny and useless at this size but that's to be expected. Audio quality is much better than echo dot.	1
3659	Perfect for a home office	1
3660	Best fish I've ever had in my life!	1
3661	Great product.	1

3665	Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!	1
3666	The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.	0
3667	So far the certified refurbished Echo Dot works well. It was a little confusing to have a green ring on the Echo Dot and not 100% know why it was there. Asked Alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. But that was not the case. Took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that I had a delivery from amazon. I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed.	1
3668	Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.	0
3669	add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  	1
3670	looks great	1
3671	I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!	1
3672	The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  	0
3673	We bot 2 on Prime day one for use as a clock/radio in the bedroom and one in the family room to control lights and watch the front door when the doorbell rings.  Music sound is very good not as good as the Echo but way better than our Dots.  If we could only buy 1 Amazon device it would be the Spot.	1
3674	This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  	0
3675	I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!	1
3676	Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0
3677	How stupid is that?	0
3678	Upgraded from echo to echo show.	1
3679	Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  	1
3680	This one just fails to create any real suspense.  	0
3681	I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
3682	The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	1
3683	Great product and Prime Day price! Took a while to figure out how to connect to my wireless network and the other Echo devices in my home. This came with a Philips smart bulb. It's better than having a clapper! I found instructions online to 'wake to music & philips light'. Very easy to set it up with the instructions. You even have an option of what song you want to wake up to!	1
3684	The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
3685	We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	0
3686	The packaging was beautiful and then there she was!! We have 2 dots and an echo plus already. Now we have the show and we love it. An echo for each room!You can also say &#34;Alexa, turn off the screen&#34; and it will go black. This is good for sleeping.	1
3687	Sad joke. Worthless.	0
3688	I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.	1

3690	Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  	1
3691	The commercials are the most misleading.	0
3692	So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have.	1
3693	This is my second Echo, I have the Dot but the speaker is weak so I purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great.	1
3694	My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.	1
3695	Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.	0
3696	No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.	0
3697	Wish it would have came with the lightbulb, but otherwise works great, fast delivery, and I enjoy using it!	1
3698	And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  	1
3699	Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off.	1
3700	Still learning it	1
3701	We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price.	1
3702	I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  	1
3703	It's like having your tv as a big tablet	1
3704	No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.	0

3709	Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.	1
3710	Great product	1
3711	This was an impulse buy and I am super happy I made the purchase. I love this so much I immediately bought my parents one. now we can video chat easily! I love all the features and how easy this is to use and set up.	1
3712	And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
3713	I only hear garbage for audio.	0
3714	Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.	1
3715	We went to a Best Buy with the intention of buying Alexa products, instead were talked into the Google Home products. Bought the Google Home and the Home Mini... has trouble from the start setting them up, and they couldn’t understand my husband (Scottish accent). After days of the “oops, something went wrong” command.. we returned them and bought the Amazon Echo Show and the Echo Plus... so easy to set up! It connected immediately to my amazon account and was way easier to navigate. They both understand commands from my husband on the first try and have yet to give an error message. We have loved these two products and should have gone with what we intended in the first place! You won’t regret your purchase!	1
3716	Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
3717	Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.	1
3718	We love it!!  We use it every day and are finding new ways to use it the longer we have it!	1
3719	Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose	0
3720	Worked great!.	1
3721	The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  	0
3722	I love this little gadget, replaces my old clock basically, love i can listen to music in the morning get weather updates, news briefs.  Let's me know when a amazon order is arriving & has been delivered etc.  Yes it's a little pricey, but purchased it on Amazon Prime Now during Prime Day and it was delivered same day for $99.	1
3723	But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  	1
3724	I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.	1
3725	In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.	1
3726	My 3rd echo device. Very easy to set up. Works perfectly.	1
3727	Easy to set up.	1
3728	My husband and I are what I would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and Echo to serve primarily as a music source.  Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!	1
3729	Great deal on prime day	1
3730	Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	0
3731	"""It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella """"The Dead.  """	1
3732	The power cord attachment tends to come loose from the outlet. The adapter may be too long and heavy. Not a big problem but annoying. When the unit is plugged in it works great.	1
3733	I love love it !	1
3734	I like it alot. I connected it so I can play my Pandora and I asked about the weather & time every morning. I got rid of my old fashioned digitol clock because I can have my music play Unlimited on this. I'm going to ask it about vacations and a few other things once I get more comfortable with it. Definitely worth the money.	1
3735	I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.	1
3736	just what I expected,already have 2 other  shows	1
3737	Can’t be used as a baby monitor which is why I had purchased it.  I didn’t realize this until I read the reviews on the Alexa skill for syncing the Nest Cam.  Considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix, surprised Amazon hasn’t upgraded the software to allow more than 39 minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the Nest app.	0
3738	Iam very pleased with my purchase.	1
3739	Nargile - I think you are great.	1

3746	The best thing since sliced bread!	1
3747	Very easy to set up. Does what is said it will. Very satisfied so far..	1
3748	Love it	1
3749	the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	1
3750	This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!	1
3751	This product is easy to use and very entertaining.  I have yet to hook it up to my TV or lights but look forward to doing so.	1
3752	Alexa wakes me up everyday for work to whatever station on Iheart radio or Spotify I want. Plus when I do get smart home devices she’ll be even more useful to me! She’s really helpful with answering random questions. The small screen sucks for video as it is small and round but it’s nice to have something to show time and pictures.	1
3753	Works as expected	1
3754	Great sound and service.	1
3755	Have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great	1
3756	Set up is so easy.	1
3757	I love my Dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the speaker would be just a little better. I know Amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but I really like to play music around the apartment when I am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized Echo. I would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. Oh well it is what it is and I still love it. I'm just going to have to find a Bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.	1
3758	No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.	1
3759	Love my Echo!	1
3760	Just like the other one	1
3761	Works great - I put this in my son's room and use the drop in option to get his attention when he is gaming or watching tv.	1
3762	I like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.	1
3763	It was horrendous.  	0
3764	I love this as a second &#34;Alexa&#34; in our bedroom.  Great for checking weather, for meditation music, and as a timer - Perfect for my husband who has to use eye drops multiple times each day and keep his eyes closed for 5 minutes.	1
3765	Up dated news	1
3766	Sprint charges for this service.	0
3767	I love this product.  I'm not very computer literate but everything is voice controlled.  I use this to keep in touch with my daughter, she lives out of town.  Now we just drop in on each other. It's like we are living net door to each other.	1
3768	The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  	0
3769	Got this on Amazon prime with the ring pro. Work really great. Being the lazy guy I am I don't need to go see who at my door anymore while I'm gaming.	1
3770	The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  	0
3771	Very disappointed.  Alexa doesn’t hear me and doesn’t respond to my requests.	0
3772	Enjoying it so much!!!	1
3773	"""The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an """"Are you being helped?"""""""	0
3774	Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.	1
3775	I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  	1
3776	It does so much more than I knew when I bought it. It pretty much runs my house, helps me fall asleep, takes care of my schedule, and entertainment	1
3777	I jumped on the bandwagon by purchasing an Echo.  I feel like there was a struggle getting connected and then three days later, the device is sharing news and weather.  Now we use it some, but have not tapped in to all options.  Still testing it out.	1
3778	I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.	1
3779	What a wonderful little Alexa enabled gadget at like the analog clock face the best	1
3780	Pretty cool. I have only begun to figure out things she does.	1
3781	none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.	0
3782	Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.	1
3783	I love it best gift I got myself	1
3784	I love to watch my wife argue with Alexa.  I woke up one night listening to Alexa talking to my cell phone. ????	1
3785	Perfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.	1
3786	So far it has worked like a charm.	1
3787	The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.	1
3788	Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  	0

3794	I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.	0
3795	I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	0
3796	This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!	1
3797	Perfect! May favorite Alexa device by far, specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cam's it does the job really well.  We changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive. Good job Amazon!	1
3798	I love it.	1
3799	I definitely like this product.  Wanted to be able to watch Netflix on my tv!  Easy to install!	1
3800	If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!	0

3803	Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  	1
3804	The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  	1
3805	I returned 2 Echo Dots & am only getting refund for 1. I returned 2 in one package. I want my refunds for both of them. They are in the same package. Can you not see them both???!!!	0

3807	This product replaces the 1st generation Fire Stick I had, and what an improvement in speed in both showing Amazon content but ALL apps downloaded on PRODUCT! I bought in on PRIME day for $19 .... BEST DEAL EVER !	1
3808	I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
3809	LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!	1
3810	My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!	0
3811	Easy to set up and sooooooo many things it can do.  Just awesome!	1
3812	works as promised	1
3813	I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.	1
3814	This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  	1
3815	Was Leary about refurbished but work great.	1
3816	There were too many close ups.  	0
3817	The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).	1
3818	My Father liked the added programing in which he is interested.	1
3819	Happy so far!.	1
3820	Easy to use	1
3821	It was easy to set up and affordable! Love it!	1
3822	This is a great tool (toy?), room-filling music, very convenient to use, just fun to have. Why only 4 stars? Supposed to work with Logitech Harmony remote: nope. Supposed to work with Denon AV receivers: nope. This may not be Amazon't fault, but advertised skills should actually work. We also have the Echo Show, and the Ring skill works correctly with that device when we want to see who is at the front door.	1
3823	She's poised and amazing.  	1
3824	I bought this for my healing room.  I play continuous spa like music. Although Alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  I didn't know I had to buy speakers too.	1
3825	Worst martini ever!	0
3826	The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  	1
3827	Very much disappointed with this company.	0
3828	Great	1
3829	The service here is fair at best.	0
3830	Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  	1
3831	I love it, it is just what I thought it would be!!!  I'm addicted!	1
3832	I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.	1
3833	I advise you to look out for it.  	1
3834	Love the Firestick! My kids love that they can talk to Alexa and get the weather, local news, etc.	1
3835	So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.	1
3836	Usual reliable Alexa	1
3837	Go watch it!  	1
3838	the Sound is fantastic for the Classic  music. is like you have the orchestra at your home. and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top, but also you can tell  &#34;Alexa volume 3&#34;	1
3839	The chefs were friendly and did a good job.	1
3840	I will never forget it now.  	1
3841	Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.	1
3842	The staff was very attentive.	1
3843	So far no major issues	1
3844	Versatile use, can watch movies or news.  Able to use as remote for vehicle.  Or use as a communication hub for the home.  Great produc!!!	1
3845	great product!	1
3846	Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.	1
3847	I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
3848	I'll definitely be in soon again.	1
3849	Couldn't be more pleased. Amazon hit this one out of the park. Looks great and runs great. Love it!	1
3850	Love the product but dislike that I can’t sync up my Apple Music for Alexa to play	1
3851	Everything was perfect the night we were in.	1
3852	I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.	1
3853	Waste your money on this game.  	1
3854	Absolutely love it. After much persuasion from a friend, I finally gave in and bought one. Let's just say that the moment Alexa enters my life, I turn around and tell Siri to get the hell out.	1
3855	Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa	1
3856	Got to love Alexa she does everything around our house	1
3857	Unreliable - I'm giving up.	0
3858	It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk.	0
3859	The echo works fine but then you get indundated with &#34;Things to try&#34;. I am not a 10 year old that needs stimulus to tell me to do things. I found there is no way to turn this off except for .... turning off the screen. If I cannot find a suitable fix for this it goes back.	0
3860	It's my second one and works well	1
3861	Nice product	1
3862	How can that be?The audio quality is poor.	0
3863	I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound.	1
3864	When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!	1
3865	Love it	1

3869	Recently cut the cord on cable television. Needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. Ordered the Amazon Fire Stick from Best Buy. Instructions were short and easy to follow. I was going to order the Amazon Ethernet Adapter because I was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought I'd wait and see. Glad I did. Wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. A few brief hiccups here and there, but I'm convinced that was from the Apps themselves. Don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what I used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. Amazon Fire Stick is limited to 1GB of memory and 8GB of storage. Thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading Apps and recording shows. So far it hasn't been any issue at all. The upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of NFL Football, might prove more troublesome when I need to record more often. I'll worry about that then. My only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. The screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. Luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded Apps and recorded shows stay in memory. Not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. Haven't tried it yet, although I don't think it'll be an issue with DirectTV Now, which I'm using right now. So far I'm loving the Amazon Fire Stick. Actually love that Amazon, which I use occasionally, come pre-installed.	1
3870	She's [Alexa] a bit dense and still learning the way I phrase things with my NY/NJ regional accent.	1
3871	This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.	1
3872	I like the compact structure of the Dot. The sound is a little too low.	1
3873	Up there with the best of Melville.  	1
3874	Very unreliable service from T-mobile !	0
3875	As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak.	0
3876	This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  	0
3877	Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.	1
3878	It was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!	1
3879	It's just lame.  	0
3880	Started taking on her own! Haven’t used it since I unplugged it that day. No one was talking, my daughter was laying in bed next to be and she just started going on about the movie Moana and completely scared the sh*t out of my daughter now.	1
3881	Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
3882	If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.	0
3883	I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).	1
3884	Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  	1
3885	Usual reliable Alexa	1
3886	Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.	1
3887	I love this, it's quick and easy to use. I love that there are so many apps you can access but disappointed some of them cost extra money to use. I also love the music app on here. I didn't think I would use it because I have Alexa echo and listen to music all the time on there. But I tried it on the fire tv and it gives you the lyric as the songs play! Love it!!	1

3893	I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  	0
3894	I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won't get to try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch.....the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rain.....and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked.	0
3895	Magical Help.	1
3896	Working great and my daughter loves it!	1
3897	The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  	0
3898	The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  	0
3899	Easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  The sound quality while for listening to music on Pandora is wonderful!!	1
3900	There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	0
3901	Alexa helps with more than just lights or music, it helps out when your kids think they know everything and you know nothing  lol  Sweet  love it  so much so I purchased 2, Alexa has been a great purchase for my uncle whom lives by himself, when I got it he wasnt so keen on it, but now its his best friend, he tells her goodmorning and she will say it back along with a description on something that is happening today or something special that happened years ago on that day, as well as sang him Happy birthday  lolol  he now has educated him self on things he never knew, and laughs at the things she may say when he waits to see he response to something hes asked  love it, and to think I was going to hate it.	1
3902	Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	0
3903	I like my uncle. But sometime it goes a little Haywire	1
3904	Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn't have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn't connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it's just not as strong.	0
3905	It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  	0
3906	Our family really loves this new Echo	1
3907	awesome device.	1
3908	I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.	1
3909	Loved them	1
3910	He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
3911	Bad Purchase.	0
3912	I was contacted by people in India. Were they suppose to charge me $79.00? It was very hard to understand their instructions. They did have control of my computer and network. I, also, bought a Cloud Cam but do not know how to make it work with Alexa.	1
3913	AMAZON SUCKS.	0
3914	Perfect condition! I love my echo	1
3915	Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.	1
3916	It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
3917	Disapointing Results.	0
3918	In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  	0
3919	Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  	0
3920	This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  	1
3921	This was a Prime Day purchase. I'm still learning my way around it. So far, so good. The addition of Alexa is nice.	1
3922	My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running.	1
3923	Great sound and easy to set up. Purchased the Echo Plus because it had a built in Hub and would make it easier to connect to devices. I am hooked on Alexa!	1
3924	I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.	1
3925	I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.	0
3926	A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.	1
3927	So far I like it 🤓	1
3928	Like it but it will take time to setup all the skills I want simply because there are so many. I already use music and Flash Briefing daily. Very satisfied. I use this along with Alexa app on my Kindle hd8	1
3929	After we learned to use this (we are still learning), we are very pleased with Echo Plus	1
3930	Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !	1
3931	The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  	0
3932	It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things	0
3933	Just the perfect cost effective solution.  Thank you Amazon.	1
3934	We love our fire stick!! The Alexa voice control is fantastic for my younger kids!!	1
3935	Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  	1
3936	Echo Show - White&nbsp;Great new addition to our Alexa home solution and now I can call back home and video chat directly from my phone. Great way to stay in touch with family.	1
3937	The story line is totally predictable.  	0
3938	It definitely was not as good as my S11.	1
3939	I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!	1
3940	Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.	0
3941	Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  	1
3942	as expected	1
3943	I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.	1
3944	I had just said to myself how I desired an assistant when I came across the Spot!  As a Mom of two things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyone’s schedules & my own. I just verbally tell Alexa what reminder or timer I need set and Voila!Having my Spot has given me the virtual assistant I so desired without having to actually hire someone.  Not to mention the many other awesome features. I have Alexa synced with my Audible & Kindle & Alex can read a book from my libraries to me.I’m still excited to see what else my Spot can do!Side note: I had wanted to purchase a Show for a while & probably still will down the line however I sooooo love my sleek little Sopt!	1
3945	My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0
3946	Mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time, it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result.	1
3947	Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes.	1
3948	Love the Echo Plus!! Much better versatility than the first generation Echo. Intercom and voice-controllable smart bulbs are awesome!	1
3949	Great product EXCEPT there is no possible way for it to act as a clock the displays the time PERMANENTLY.  When in 'Clock' mode, the screen rotates between the clock face and a 'Things to Try' screen.  I intended on buying several units for my house, but I do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me.  Acting as clock should be a BASIC feature of the Echo Spot.  How could you get this wrong, Amazon??  #FAIL	0
3950	I like almost everything	1
3951	It is fantastic.	1
3952	Love the music the stories	1
3953	I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	1
3954	Works great, video call function nice when communicating through drop-in	1
3955	Ray Charles is legendary.  	1
3956	this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.	1
3957	Sound quality is disappointing.	1
3958	I love this technology. I'm older, but this is so easy to set up and use. I have the dot in my bedroom and use it for everything I use my echo for which is in the living room.	1
3959	The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.	1
3960	- the food is rich so order accordingly.	1

3962	Love seeing everything in the display!	1

3964	Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.	1
3965	The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.	0
3966	Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  	0
3967	Great Prime Day Buy!	1
3968	So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  	0
3969	Good case!.	1
3970	Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  	1
3971	NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(	0
3972	I'm super pissd.	0
3973	It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  	1
3974	Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.	1
3975	The fries were great too.	1
3976	I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging.	1
3977	I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.	1
3978	I’m not sure why or how Amazonia asking me about this purchase. I got it as a gift from my kids for Mother’s Day...  It was not bought from my account. Lil bit creepy 😑. I haven’t really had much use for it as no one calls, they text. So that part meh. The other things it does are no different than the other Alexa products.	1
3979	Excellent product, mint condition for a refurbished unit - you would never know it's been refurbished!	1
3980	Horrible phone.	0
3981	I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her.	1

3983	It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	0

3986	Worst Customer Service Ever.	0
3987	Still learning what it can do. Amazing. Simple, works right out of a box. Only frustration is getting Amazon Alexa app t show up on my Samsung/Galaxy with Google's Android.	1
3988	love it	1
3989	Waited and waited and waited.	0
3990	I bought this for a family member as a gift. I called her to see how she likes it & she said she loves it‼️	1
3991	Once connected it brought so many options to view. We connected with quite a few of the channels.Must have,	1
3992	Nice upgrade from an Echo Dot.	1
3993	Needs to be smarter	1
3994	The pizza selections are good.	1
3995	Two weeks after setting it up it no longer works.  No connection, no light, no sound.  I guess I shouldn't have purchased a refurbished Dot.	0
3996	Easy set up very user friendly	1
3997	This place was such a nice surprise!	1
3998	That was nice.  	1
3999	Terrible service!	0
4000	Great speaker, great microphone response.  Loving my purchase and the beginning of my smart home.	1
4001	Excellent product, set up with ease as well.	1
4002	Gift for my man. He doesn’t like that you have to plug it in and the pictures do not show the cord. Would prefer it cordless. Still works though for the purpose we bought it.	1
4003	I am so disappointed in this product.  I tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed.  Hours with Amazon technicians.. resetting each of them.  The app didn't connect the Echo Plus to the internet connection.  Tried using the application on a phone, a tablet and on a Chromebook... No luck.  There are no clean directions on the application.  Probably sending this back to Amazon..mark this as Not ready for prime time.	0
4004	I was suppose to get the “free” lightbulb with purchase. It did not come with Echo. Upon reading more carefully, it says to click a box to receive free bulb. 😳 of course I want the free bulb, who wouldn’t? Just a sneaky way for them to get out of having to give so many “ free”  bulbs away. Disappointed!  I have yet to set up my echo, our first purchase on any alexia device. Debating if we want to keep it. It did come quickly with my prime membership.	1
4005	His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  	1
4006	Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!	1
4007	This battery is an excellent bargain!	1
4008	Put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm. Works great. Every morning I get the weather and news when I get up. Also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and I have.	1
4009	I bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly. If they weren't labeled as refurbished I wouldn't have known	1
4010	Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at.	1
4011	I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0
4012	I love my amazon sticks	1
4013	Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !	1
4014	All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	1
4015	Very bad this device, I don’t know if it’s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking. When you talk you have to yell super lauded	0
4016	Works like a champ.	1
4017	Love it!! It is so handy and easy to use. Got it for my classroom, but I many need to just get another one.	1
4018	This movie is BAD.  	0
4019	It was delicious!!!	1
4020	I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge.	1
4021	We have a great time using this as a family. Even my toddler can talk to her . There are a few features I wish it would learn to do  but overall we love it and glad we brought it over the Google home !	1
4022	My first smart buy..I am loving it and all the great things Alexa can do.	1
4023	Absolutely love it!!!!	1
4024	Love this thing.. Best toy I've bought myself in awhile.. So far I have a smart plug connected running my Ac.  And the wifi light bulbs.  Baseball scores, weather are  cool but the music is the best feature.	1
4025	Convenient and fun.	1
4026	The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.	0
4027	I would love this but there is no way to stop the screen from constantly scrolling through “things to try”. If Amazon would make this a setting I would change my review to 5 stars.	0
4028	Love it, love it!!!!!!!!	1
4029	Great for using with your home stereo.	1
4030	Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.	1
4031	It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?	1
4032	Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  	0
4033	It's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.	1
4034	Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	1
4035	Love it, Love it, Love it!!! Bought it on Prime Day, then had buyers remorse, but once I got it, it was Love at first sight.	1
4036	Stay Away From the Q!.	0
4037	However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.	0
4038	Disconnects often	0
4039	BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.	1
4040	It's fun to imagine the household management options ...Some info questions baffle Alexa, but other options are cool - esp. music-related ...	1
4041	That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).	0
4042	I love this bluetooth!	1
4043	She carries the movie well.  	1
4044	The mic is great.	1
4045	Works good for the most part. You ask it some questions and she says she doesn’t know. I thought she was supposed to know everything	1
4046	Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0
4047	All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.	1
4048	OMG, the food was delicioso!	1
4049	Fun and useful. We're still learning new tricks and useful functionalities. This is the future of human to computer interface and household automation. Just like Star Trek! Who knew it would be here so soon?	1
4050	Amazing paroduct	1
4051	ALEXA IS NOT AS SMART AS SIRI! CANNOT CANCEL SNOOZE AFTER ALARM GOES OFF. HAVE TO CANCEL PRE-SET ALARM FOR WEEKDAYS.	0
4052	The result is a film that just don't look right.  	0
4053	We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.	1
4054	I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.	1
4055	I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  	1
4056	Regrettably, the film fails.  	0
4057	Great choice!	1
4058	Works amazingly. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it.	1
4059	Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better.	1
4060	I am very excited and happy with this. It was a breeze to set up and my favorite feature is reading my Kindle and going to sleep to Thunderstorm music.	1
4061	This is our first step into a smart home. Soon as I added one item to the grocery list I started loving it. My wife was so-so about it ‘til I opened rain sounds. She’s a convert. 😉 LOVE these and the dots.	1
4062	Turned our old TV into a smart TV. Really easy interface. Have bought 4 now.	1
4063	Great. Definitely gets a little old after a while but for $30 I can't really regret it at all. Love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to The Smiths.	1
4064	I have a friend now.	1
4065	The RI style calamari was a joke.	0
4066	This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.	1
4067	Very easy to use! Makes finding shows and movies a snap.	1
4068	As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.	1
4069	I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.	1
4070	The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	1
4071	Love it just as good as a new one	1
4072	Great product	1
4073	Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.	1
4074	I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.	1
4075	This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	0
4076	This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.	0
4077	When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	0
4078	The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	0
4079	In short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
4080	Very bad Experience!	0
4081	I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound.	1
4082	Good device	1
4083	Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.	1
4084	Warning - Stay away.	0
4085	good protection and does not make phone too bulky.	1
4086	It makes talking with your grandchildren so easy, especially for the little ones.  Outstanding product!	1
4087	All the new Amazon products I have are great everything I bought refurbished is complete garbage. I will never purchase Amazon refurbished again total dissatisfaction	0
4088	This was just an additional one for my other TV. Loved it so much use it on the regular TV. Easy to set up and fairly easy to navigate. I don’t waste my money on regular TV cable or anything else. This is enough for me as I don’t watch too much TV.	1
4089	Works as expected, very easy to setup and use	1
4090	I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.	1
4091	I don'r know how to use it yet.  Need more explicit directions for the electeonically challenged.  I did not get the feee lifht bulb that was part of the package.	1
4092	Husband loves it!	1
4093	CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.	1
4094	The bartender was also nice.	1
4095	Makes accessing all of the Apps easy. Love the voice control.	1
4096	Echos are great I have a few of them through out our home .  All in voice range to ask a question. Say a command to turn lights on or off. Or my favorite is play music all though the house.	1
4097	I like the list ability and the music I can play.  I do not like that I can not create a playlist without using the app and even then Alexa will not play my songs I have to do it through my tablet or phone.  I also do not like that Alex can not print again it has to be done through the app.	1
4098	I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music.	1
4099	Same as new	1
4100	I having it in my living room. Music sounds really good in my living room . I can hear it upstairs.	1
4101	Love this product!!	1
4102	The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
4103	But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  	1
4104	It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	1
4105	We all love her!	1
4106	Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  	0
4107	I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.	0
4108	The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.	1
4109	NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  	0
4110	Adapter does not provide enough charging current.	0
4111	Love everything about this....	1
4112	I like echo spot. I bought it to use as an alarm clock. One negative that i didnt really think about, when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy, its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm, or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes. In this case a clock with buttons seems to work better	1
4113	I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably.	1
4114	But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  	0
4115	Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!	1
4116	I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!	1
4117	It's an echo, and it works.  For the price it's great deal. Have had no issues with it.  As with all dots, the speaker is a bit tinny, but good for a second unit, or if you are like me, you can attach it to an external speaker for more sound.Good buy	1
4118	Poor product.	0
4119	Very impressed with look, clarity of sound and color.	1
4120	Don't make the same mistake I did.	0
4121	But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  	0
4122	Love this! So many options!	1
4123	Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard.	1
4124	Great to play music throughout the house. Great and easily fits in my decor of my home	1
4125	None of them are engaging or exciting.  	0
4126	Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo	1
4127	Love it!!	1
4128	very good product, well made.	1
4129	Don't waste your money.  I own an echo gen 1, and echo gen 2 and a dot. They all do a far better job of voice recognition that the Echo Show.  In fact, it is so bad that it is virtually useless.  Also, the speaker is incredibly bass heavy....so much so that it is hard to understand voices.  I've worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble, but it still sounds awful.  Finally, the screen just doesn't add much.  I can't see if from across the room, it rarely activates in any meaningful way, and when it doesn't, it is more of a distraction than a help.(Using FaceTime is so much more practicalthan using the Show.) I'm surprised Amazon didn't make this a little more useful than it is.  Perhaps in the future, but for now, it is a waste of time and money.	0
4130	This is our first Alexa.... we love it!!	1
4131	Sound very nice perfect for the price	1
4132	To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  	0
4133	I've never been treated so bad.	0
4134	The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  	1
4135	The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  	0
4136	Raw and sublimely moving.  	1
4137	Works well. Just disappointed with the speaker quality. But hooked it up to old computer speakers.	1
4138	It does not pick up my voice unless I yell most times.	1
4139	This product is even better than I imagined. I love the timer setting, it reminds me to put the clothes in the dryer if i ask it to, and i love shopping list feature.  My family enjoys the games too! It’s made my life a little more easy! Alexa is my personal assistant. :)	1
4140	I've had better atmosphere.	0
4141	Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	1
4142	My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.	0
4143	Very impressed.  Simple to use	1
4144	I use this to control my smart home.	1
4145	You can't beat that.	1
4146	I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	0
4147	How easy if was to set up.	1
4148	I really like it works well trivia games and shopping on it is fun.Sometimes it misunderstands what I say but other then that the speaker is decent video chat is good but you do need to be in a well lit room so the other end can see you lol.	1
4149	I'll be looking for a new earpiece.	0
4150	bad fit, way too big.	0
4151	You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
4152	2 Thumbs Up!!	1
4153	This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  	0
4154	Love the dot	1
4155	It does everything the description said it would.	1
4156	so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity	1
4157	I wasted my little money with this earpiece.	0
4158	Horrible!  	0
4159	Was excited to try this on my new Element TV.  Unfortunately even though my TV is 5 feet away from my router i get maddening disconnections and buffering.  Thought this little device was supposed to take care of that issue.  It didn’t!	0
4160	I love it...... I want to get another one very  very  soon	1
4161	This one is simply a disappointment.	0
4162	Alarm, calendar, reminders	1
4163	I love Alexa, but the sound on the dot is not the best. I own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there’s a SIGNIFICANT difference in sound. The dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it’s coming off a cheap portable speaker. I was REALLY disappointed. I returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also.	1
4164	Pretty cool device. Still have a lot to learn, but I'm changing channels on my Fios, and getting info needed. the speaker is great for what I needed it for, which mainly is music.	1
4165	I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0
4166	This is a good joint.	1
4167	The waitresses are very friendly.	1
4168	I am sorry I made this purchase.	0
4169	I love my Echo Plus. The only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient  to use outdoors.	1
4170	Love it!	1
4171	All the music I can listen too, Also the movie I can watch I can see my ring doorbell .	1
4172	Good	1
4173	Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.	1
4174	So far so good.  Not to tech savvy so, I'm still trying to figure out what I can do with it but, it was easy to set up and so far easy to use.  Lots of apps that it can use.  I will have to play with it some more but its fun to have.	1
4175	Exactly like new, can tell the difference from my new dot I got prior to this one, works perfectly. LOVE Alexa	1
4176	Battery is terrible.	0
4177	We like it a lot, sound is better than the original echo, the bass feels deeper.  The screen is cool, though, havent got a lot of use out of it though.	1
4178	Love the fire stick. I can download watch great movies. Instead of searching I use Alexa voice.  Prime doesn't offer very many newer movies is the only negative.I also wished there was a way you could set it up to post newest movies first.	1
4179	The ambiance was incredible.	1
4180	The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	0
4181	She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great	1
4182	The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  	1
4183	By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
4184	During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.	0
4185	Don't miss it.  	1
4186	I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them	1
4187	It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.	1
4188	This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  	0
4189	Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.	1
4190	I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).	1
4191	I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0
4192	Thoroughly disappointed!	0
4193	Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1
4194	The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!	1
4195	Such a handy item to have on my night stand. She reads to me at night and gets me all set for the day in the morning with my calendar and weather views.	1
4196	Love it just wish I could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription	1
4197	I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!	1
4198	Cheap and cheap sound.	0
4199	The phone is sturdy and waterproof.	1
4200	It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.	0
4201	these are additional alexa based devices to make access better from other parts  of our homes rather than trying to shout questions or instructions through out the house, lol. we wouldn't be without alexa for the variety of functions that she performs.	1
4202	Works and sounds great! My house is barely 1100sf, and I have this sitting on my kitchen counter. I can hear it, and speak to it from any room. Lots of functionality still to discover.	1
4203	Easy setup. Alexa needs a lot of training,	1
4204	Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.	0
4205	I really love the hub feature	1
4206	Never would know it was refurbished.	1
4207	Works much easier than our 3 year old one. Better internet resemption	1
4208	All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  	0
4209	I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  	1
4210	Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.	0
4211	Love this!!! My daughter enjoys telling Alexa what to do. Haha	1
4212	The installation and connection to my Wi-Fi was so easy! Getting the Amazon Prime and Netflix going was a breeze. I have not used a voice remote before. That was amazing (yes, I am old school). I will be reviewing more features and options as I have time, but I am very excited to own such a product that lives up to the all the great things I have read and heard.	1
4213	The problem I have with this item could just be my inexperience. I ordered the wrong thing, but then decided I’d set it up and use Alexa. I was trying to replace a small Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom. Thought I could learn as I go. I downloaded the app, but never could get the Echo to sync with my iPhone. I’ve decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended.	1
4214	I bought on Prime Day and so glad I did. It’s easy to use and lots of customization options. I know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read, but I disagree.	1
4215	I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.	0
4216	I cant figure out how to use it.	0
4217	By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  	0
4218	This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.	0
4219	LOVE LOVE LOVE my new and free assistant!  :)	1
4220	Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
4221	The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
4222	"""I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was """"The Stranger"""" and I loved it.  """	1
4223	I took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for $29. Looks brand new...no excuses or disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the Alexa App on my iPhone was flawless. Listening to my favorite tunes through a Bose Bluetooth setup and couldn't be happier. Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80's music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box! If I didn't discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny!	1
4224	They really want to make your experience a good one.	1
4225	Cool	1
4226	Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it’s great that I was able to set that as default. There’s not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He’s a lot more calmer and doesn’t bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It’s a must have!	1
4227	Really enjoying my firestick can’t wait to get rid of  cable such a waste of money.	1
4228	In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	1
4229	I love it, in my living room	1
4230	The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.	1
4231	It is shameful.  	0
4232	Love it. Beautiful experience especially if hooked to smart lighting and other accessories.	1
4233	The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	1
4234	It has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start, even from a distance. A lot of the skills are excellent. I've added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it's ridiculous that it can't access YouTube.It might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task; it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event. I imagine this is a functionality people would use often.	1
4235	Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	0
4236	The speaker sounds really good	1
4237	Easy to set up and start using.. works as advertised.	1
4238	i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.	0
4239	To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	1
4240	I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa	1
4241	This is outstanding works awesome the music sound very clear and loud and Alexa is very smart	1
4242	But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  	0
4243	Great Phone.	1
4244	I love this clock, I just have to tell it to set my alarm.  No more fussing with buttons!	1
4245	I bought it mainly to be a speaker when playing music or videos on my phone. Not working for me. Read instructions but not working for me.	1
4246	The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0
4247	It's pretty easy.	1
4248	Absolutly love it !	1
4249	Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions.	1
